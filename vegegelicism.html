        A few years ago, I made
        <a href="antiveg.html">a parody of the anti-vegetarian movement</a>. It
        is a bit outdated by now, as it was written before COVID. The arguments
        used in the vegetarianism debate are considerably different in the
        post-COVID world.

        It is difficult to explain why murder is wrong if eating meat and
        wearing leather isn't wrong. The most obvious answer is that non-human
        animals are not capable of suffering (including physical pain), like
        Descartes claimed. However, modern science makes it clear that for birds
        and mammals (except possibly those with severely devolved nervous
        systems, such as naked mole rats), and probably even for octopuses,
        that's not the case. And I think almost everybody would agree that, even
        in Descartes'es time, there was no reason to think what Descartes
        claimed. Furthermore, if the way products are produced today affects at
        all the ethics of buying those products, then it is unethical to buy
        eggs from factory farms. Most of the antibiotics today are used in the
        egg industry (it's hard to tell the exact percentage, but it is probably
        around 70%), and that causes superbacteria. If you want to do the number
        one thing that will reduce the chances of a pandemic of superbacteria
        occurring within our lifetimes, either stop eating eggs or find some
        small farmer which you are certain doesn't pump his chickens with
        antibiotics and buy eggs from him.<br />
        What's the best way of spreading this message? I wish I knew the answer.
        However, I have years of experience of spreading that message, so I know
        what <b>not</b> to do, at least not to be dangerous. So, here are those
        things:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't yell unrelated fringe claims, such as Flat-Earthism,
              radical anarchism, global warming denialism, and so on.</b
            ><br />
            As for Flat-Earthism, look, if you so blatantly reject the science
            of the shape of the Earth, what's your justification for accepting
            the much softer science that vegan diet is healthy? Furthermore,
            while there are some Flat-Earther's arguments that make some degree
            of sense (the one with sunrays not seeming parallel...), for most of
            the Flat-Earther's arguments, you need to reject logic to accept
            them as valid arguments, and not only science. If you believe in
            Flat-Earthism, make sure you've watched
            <a href="https://youtu.be/6uldKfUPWrg">this video I made</a> (if you
            cannot open it, try downloading
            <a href="FlatEarth.mp4">this MP4</a> and opening it in VLC or
            something like that). Look, I understand it, we are living in a
            schizoid society and most of the people are holding plenty of
            irrational beliefs. But Earth being round is not one of those
            irrational beliefs.<br />
            As for radical anarchism... Aren't you afraid you will make exactly
            the causes you are fighting for worse? Who do you think is doing
            more to fight superbacteria: is it the few people (vegans...) who
            boycott the egg industry, or is it the governments who are
            regulating antibiotics? The answer seems obvious to me: governments
            are doing more. And just like the science suggests that
            <i>you</i> shouldn't buy eggs from factory farms, it also suggests
            (in fact, even more so) that the government should regulate the use
            of antibiotics. Furthermore, you are using the Internet to spread
            your message, right? What do you think would happen to the Internet
            if there were no government regulations (not even the basic
            regulations such as that ISPs should set up their DNS servers to
            respond only to the requests from the IP addresses they are supposed
            to respond to)? Well, I have a Bachelor degree in computer
            engineering, and I think I can safely tell you that, without the
            government regulation, the Internet would be paralyzed by
            denial-of-service attacks. If you believe in radical anarchism, make
            sure you've watched
            <a href="https://youtu.be/BvokFAbWC1c?si=wQqU0daUF-L_DWEq"
              >this video I made</a
            >
            (<a href="anti-anarchism.mp4">MP4</a>). Look, I understand it, the
            vast majority of regulations are nonsensible. We would be better off
            if the government were more restrained in how much regulation it can
            pass. And what governments around the world are doing in an attempt
            to curb violent crime is wildly inappropriate, and so is what the
            governments around the world did in an attempt to curb the spread of
            COVID-19. But some regulations are necessary.<br />
            As for global warming denialism... Look up Lysenkoism. That's what
            happens when pseudosciences similar to global warming denialism
            (which try to conquer the nature we don't understand instead of
            trying to minimize our impact on nature) get institutionalized.
            Advocating such pseudosciences is incredibly irresponsible. Only
            <i>slightly</i> less irresponsible than saying that we should
            continue massively using antibiotics in the egg industry. (I say
            &quot;slightly less&quot; because the dangers of global warming are
            indeed hypothetical: we don't know what will happen in the 21st
            century society if the Earth gets two degrees warmer. The dangers of
            a pandemic of superbacteria are not at all hypothetical: we have
            seen what happens in the 21st century society when a pandemic
            occurs.) Furthermore, if you so blatantly reject the scientific
            consensus of the anthropogenic global warming, what is your
            justification for accepting the consensus that vegan diet can be
            healthy? Just like with Flat-Earthism, as much as you swing the
            pendulum to the left, it will swing to the right. Look, I understand
            it, hysterically banning fossil fuels without providing alternatives
            would lead to a catastrophy. But that doesn't mean we should do
            nothing about global warming. As for the anti-nuclear movement, it's
            a different rhetoric, but the practical effects are similar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't be anti-supplements.</b><br />
            Look, I realize the supplements are unnatural and are sometimes
            harmful. But you need to understand that deficiencies (which can be
            easily cured using supplements) are harmful and sometimes even
            deadly. The COVID-19 pandemic was made significantly worse by
            widespread Vitamin D deficiency. We can politicize with the numbers,
            but the fact is that many people who died from COVID-19 would still
            be alive today if they weren't deficient in Vitamin D. It's
            difficult to imagine that people widely taking Vitamin D supplements
            would have killed so many people with overdoses. And in 1920s
            Valpovo, there was a study suggesting that Vitamin D deficiency was
            one of the best predictors of who will die of tuberculosis.<br />
            And you need to realize the supposed dangers of many supplements are
            either non-existant or wildly exaggerated. For example, nobody has
            yet died of Vitamin B12 overdose. Not a single one. As for calcium
            supplements supposedly causing heart attacks... Well, that appears
            to only be true in elderly smokers, and not in general population.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't demonize protein intake.</b><br />
            Look, it's true that human beings need very little protein... if it
            contains precisely the amino acids that human body needs (like in
            the human milk). The protein in real food is not like that. Much
            less is the protein found in plant food. For many people around the
            world, wheat is the main source of protein, and they suffer from
            lysine deficiency. If you keep demonizing protein intake (saying
            that people shouldn't eat soy or legumes), and lysine deficiency
            gets more common because of that, you are responsible.<br />
            Not to mention the supposed reasons why people shouldn't eat a lot
            of protein are gibberish. For the claim that protein causes your
            blood to become acidic and cause the calcium in your bones to go
            into your kidneys... Look, studies which look for a correlation
            between protein intake and osteoporosis tend to find little or no
            effect, whereas the studies which look for a correlation between
            Vitamin K deficiency and osteoporosis tend to find a huge effect. As
            for the claim that protein causes type-2-diabetes... Which mechanism
            are you proposing? At least when you say &quot;<i
              >Protein demineralizes the bones and causes kidney stones.</i
            >&quot;, it's obvious which mechanism you are proposing. When you
            say that protein causes type-2-diabetes, not even that is
            obvious.<br />
            It is true that there are studies that supposedly show low-protein
            diets help with all kinds of health problems, however, a problem
            with nearly all of them is that they don't control for allergies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't claim that methionine is the real enemy of the heart
              health.</b
            ><br />
            It's true that methionine raises your cholesterol levels. However,
            people who say that don't seem to understand the scale we are
            talking about. The food that's highest in methionine is sesame
            seeds. Do you realize how much sesame seeds you would have to eat to
            raise your cholesterol levels by 5%? The answer, if the studies on
            rodents are anything to judge by, is around 300 grams per day.
            Hardly anybody eats that much methionine. For comparison, a diet
            rich in saturated fat can easily increase your cholesterol levels by
            30%.<br />
            And the moment you start talking about sesame seeds causing heart
            attacks on a forum where there are people educated in nutritional
            science, you are probably bound to be laughed out of the debate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't claim that following some weird diet is better for managing
              type-2-diabetes than insulin is.</b
            ><br />
            You need to understand that, before insulin was invented, if you
            were diagnozed with type-2-diabetes, you only had months to live.
            And people were trying to manage their type-2-diabetes with all
            kinds of diets. None of them worked, at least not nearly as well as
            insulin works. Your weird diet idea has, in all likelihood, been
            tried, and it didn't work.<br />
            And I think the reason why such claims (that some diet is better at
            managing type-2-diabetes than insulin is) appeal to many people is
            the same reason why anti-vaxxer claims are appealing: the time when
            type-2-diabetes was a death sentence happened just long enough ago
            that nobody remembers it. Just like the claim that unvaccinated
            children are healthier: it seems appealing because the time before
            vaccines happened just long enough ago that nobody remembers it. And
            another reason why the idea that low-carbohydrate diets help against
            type-2-diabetes appeals to many people is because people are
            ignorant of basic cybernetics and think that, if you mess up the
            controller, the control system will be fine so long as there is no
            noise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't claim that some diet which doesn't cut the calories is
              going to help you lose weight.</b
            ><br />
            Not only would that require everything we know about nutritional
            science to be false, it is also hard to make compatible with
            thermodynamics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't claim that sugar doesn't cause type-2-diabetes.</b><br />
            This applies also to people who are denying that saturated fat
            causes heart disease. Honestly, does anybody really believe this
            nonsense? I simply don't see how anybody could. The evidence that
            sugar causes type-2-diabetes and that saturated fat causes heart
            disease is everything we know about biochemistry (saturated fat
            raising your LDL cholesterol, fructose in sugar causing insulin
            resistance...). The main argument against that appears to be
            &quot;<i
              >Here are some dubious statistics that sugar consumption reached
              its peak in the US back in 1990s (and there are more people with
              type-2-diabetes now than in 1990s).</i
            >&quot; and &quot;<i
              >Here are some dubious statistics that saturated fat consumption
              in the US reached its peak in the 1970s (and heart disease today
              is more common than in 1970s).</i
            >&quot;. That's literally less compelling than Flat-Earthism.
            Flat-Earthers have arguments (one with apparently-converging
            sunrays) that are more compelling than those arguments. In case it
            is not obvious, those arguments are ignoring the fact that there are
            way more people now who live long enough to get those diseases.

          <li>
            <b>Don't propagate coconuts as healthy food.</b><br />
            You need to understand that the claim that HDL helps against heart
            disease, although commonly repeated, is not really mainstream
            science. And claiming that something that increases both your HDL
            and your LDL helps against heart disease is... unlikely at best.<br />
            The evidence for the claim that high-fat (ketogenic) diets help
            against epilepsy is rather thin, and saying that coconuts help
            prevent various neurological disorders is pure speculation.

            <b>Don't claim that eggs are worse for heart health than meat is.</b
            ><br />
            Look, there are two explanations as for why eggs are correlated with
            heart disease:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Cholesterol you eat, via some unknown physiological mechanism,
                causes heart disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                People tend to eat bacon with eggs, which is high in both salt
                and saturated fat.
              </li>
            </ol>
            If you think the first explanation is more likely, we would like to
            hear your reasoning.<br />
            If you mean that eggs are worse than meat for public health
            (superbacteria), then, sure, they are. Way more antibiotics are used
            in the egg industry than in the meat industry.

              >Don't fight for the rights of animals that are probably not
              sentient.</b
            ><br />
            For example, fish. To claim that sharks feel pain, you basically
            need to reject entire neuroscience: sharks have no nociceptors. To
            claim that higher fish feel pain, while you don't need to reject
            <i>entire</i> neuroscience, you need to reject quite a few things we
            think we know about neuroscience: higher fish have little or no
            type-c neurofibres, which appear to be necessary to feel pain.
            Furthermore, to claim that fish feel pain, you need to invent an
            ad-hoc reason why fish don't act like they feel pain: a fish with a
            hole in its fin continues swimming normally. Understand that
            fighting for the rights of fish is not only not morally virtuous, it
            is also morally objectionable: it diverts the resources from what
            they should be spent on (on fighting for human rights and rights of
            sentient animals).<br />
            UPDATE on 28/02/2024: I received some criticism on an Internet forum
            that I am misusing the word &quot;<i>sentient</i>&quot; here. That
            fish are supposedly sentient because they, for example, have eyes to
            see, and &quot;<i>sentient</i>&quot; means having senses. In my
            opinion, if that's what &quot;<i>sentient</i>&quot; means, then
            sentience is not a valid criterion for whether or not some living
            being has moral value. You know what John Stuart Mill, one of the
            early proponents of animal rights, said: &quot;<i
              >The question is not whether they can reason or think, but whether
              they can suffer.</i
            >&quot;? Well, yeah, the question is not whether animals can sense,
            but whether they can suffer.

              bonding than lions and tigers (which would be an absurd argument

            Although commonly repeated, that claim is almost certainly wrong.
            Milk from grass-fed cows does contain omega-3 acids, however, the
            type of omega-3 acids that it contains, the ALA, is almost
            undigestible by humans (human liver can only convert around 5% of
            ALA to DHA). Around 90% of omega-3 acids in milk from grass-fed cows
            is ALA, and human beings can only use DHA.<br />
            And you need to understand that, while DHA does raise your HDL
            cholesterol, the evidence that it translates to lower risk of heart
            attacks is very thin. A lot more thin than the evidence that
            saturated fat cause heart attacks.

              >If slaughterhouses had glass walls, there would be a lot more
              vegetarians.</i
            >&quot;. The fact is that most people seem to be fine with many
            things only if they are done by others on their behalf. For
            instance, hardly anybody would
            <a href="https://youtu.be/YIZd4x0mD0I?si=m3rzc7KcJBjGJF3D"
              >ask their neighbour to pay off their student loans</a
            >, yet many people (if not most) are fine with proposing free
            colleges (when the government asks their neighbours to pay off their
            student loans on their behalf). And merely pointing that out is not
            likely to convince many people.

            <b>Don't claim rice milk is better for climate than cow's milk.</b
            ><br />
            I don't know that and you don't know that either. The fact is that
            both rice milk and cow's milk emit tons of methane during their
            production. Oat milk is far better than both of them.<br />
            I realize that oat milk is more expensive than rice milk. However,
            if we are going to fight global warming, we need to be prepared that
            fighting global warming is going to cost us something. That's not to
            say we shouldn't do that. But we shouldn't expect there to always be
            a cheap solution to the problems such as that of milk emitting
            methane. The problem of global warming is very complicated.

            <b
              >Don't claim that meat is kept artificially inexpensive by
              government policies.</b
            ><br />
            While, in many countries, governments are indeed trying to make meat
            cheaper by government subsidies, the effectiveness of such policies
            is dubious at best. Look, price is determined by supply and demand,
            not by the labor it takes to produce something (look up &quot;<i
              >labour theory of value</i
            >&quot;). Milton Friedman famously argued government subsidies, in
            the long run, make all food more expensive as well as increasing the
            price of arable land and agricultural machinery (by increasing the
            demand for those things, as more people want to be farmers when
            there are subsidies). And, as far as I understand it, most
            economists today agree with him.

            <b
              >Don't advocate for governments to ban meat because of
              pandemics.</b
            ><br />
            Please understand that it being illegal to eat bats in China didn't
            stop COVID-19 from jumping from bats to humans. In fact, it arguably
            made it more likely to happen, because the bats which were eaten
            weren't receiving basic veterinary care (as it was, well, illegal).
            Meat being illegal might decrease the chance of a pandemic of a
            superbacteria happening (if it would even do that, considering that
            way more antibiotics are used in the egg industry than in the meat
            industry), but it will certainly massively increase the risk of
            virus pandemics happening.

        I am sure there are more, but those are ones I consider the most
        important, and should give people a starting point on doing
        vegegelicism.

        UPDATE on 12/02/2024: In case somebody asks you why you are a
        vegetarian, I think a good response is: &quot;<i
          >Please, let's talk about something fun, not about farms where they
          torture animals.</i
