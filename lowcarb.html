        So, I will make a response to common arguments made by proponents of the
        low-carb diets. I have read something about it, and it seems to me it's
        a dangerous diet fad. I have made a few YouTube videos about related
        topics, but it seems to me it's a lot of effort with minimal gains in
        popularity, so I will write a blog-post this time. First, let me address
        something to my fellow vegetarians reading this: this will not be
        particularly useful in propagating vegetarianism, because very few
        people who are against vegetarianism actually believe in low-carb diets.
        So, don't just point people to this without making sure they actually
        believe in low-carb diets, otherwise, they are going to feel
        misrepresented. Equivalently, if you aren't a vegetarian, but you also
        don't believe in low-carb diets, don't feel insulted, I am in no way
        implying the quotes I respond to here are likely to represent you.<br />
        So, for those of you who are unaware of what low-carb diets are, let's
        start with a little history. In ancient times, a standard treatment for
        epilepsy was fasting, completely or mostly abstaining from food for
        extended periods of time. Of course, as you probably realize, medicine
        back then was not really based on science and was in many, if not most
        cases, worse than useless. The standard treatment for many diseases was
        bloodletting, which continued all the way up to 19th century.
        Bloodletting was counter-productive in most cases (it was even used to
        treat anaemia), and in those few cases it was effective (high blood
        pressure...), it merely alleviated the symptoms. Yet, the wrong
        tradition continued for millennia. Then, in the early 1920s, a physician
        called Russell Morse Wilder came up with an idea that, since a diet low
        in carbohydrates and low in protein has similar physiological results as
        fasting does (hypoglycemia and liver producing ketone bodies), such a
        diet could also be helpful against epilepsy. So he coined the term
        <i>ketogenic diet</i>, as a diet that makes your body run primarily on
        ketone bodies rather than glucose.

        Namely, in case you didn't know, our cells are capable of getting energy
        not only from glucose (via mitochondria), but also from fatty substances
        called ketone bodies. Producing energy from ketone bodies is actually
        evolutionary much older (dates back before eukaryotes), but it's rarely
        used in modern organisms because producing energy using mitochondria is
        much more efficient. Protein restriction is needed because your liver
        can convert some types of amino-acids into glucose, and, in fact, it
        regularly does so, because that's triggered not only by actual lack of
        glucose in blood, but also in response to fructose and saturated fat,
        which make your liver behave as if there was no insulin (production of
        which is triggered by glucose) in blood. And, as many of you probably
        know, converting protein into glucose has a side effect of producing
        very low-density lipoprotein, the most dangerous form of cholesterol.
        Human body can't convert fat into carbohydrates. Only certain species of
        plants can convert long-chain fatty acids into cellulose in case
        photosynthesis fails, which is then used not for energy, but for cell
        division. So, basically, a ketogenic diet is one that is based mostly on
        avocados and coconuts, and possibly a little meat (but not too much
        meat, because of the protein restriction).<br />
        Nearly 100 years have passed, and science still hasn't found an answer
        to the question how can ketogenic diets or fasting possibly help against
        epilepsy. And more we know about human brain, less plausible it seems
        that fasting or ketogenic diet help against epilepsy. Anti-diabetic
        drugs that result in hypoglycemia don't appear to be effective against
        epilepsy, and neither do the drugs that cause the liver to produce
        ketone bodies (acetone, as we know from the studies on rats, probably
        has slight anti-convulsion properties, but only at dangerous levels far
        above the levels liver would ever produce). Also, the computer models of
        the brain predict that it should have a slight negative effect on
        epilepsy, since ketogenic diet raises the levels of
        &#946;-hydroxybutyrate, which in turn raises ATP levels and prevents the
        potassium from getting into neurons at the same time. Higher ATP levels
        give the neurons more energy (so they can fire more intensely), while
        the lack of potassium inside neurons makes them malfunction (fire when
        they aren't supposed to, and that should lead to seizures). High-quality
        studies are, just with any supposed diet cure, difficult or impossible
        to make because they are very hard to single-blind, yet alone
        double-blind<a href="#footnote1" name="backTo1"><sup>[1]</sup></a
        >. The only double-blind
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18717710/">study</a> about that
        that I am aware of has failed to find a statistically significant effect
        of diet on EEG-detectable seizures, and the effect of the diet on the
        subjectively reported frequency and severity of the seizures was right
        on the margin of error. Those studies that show it works, of course,
        nearly always also show it also increases kidney stones<a

        risk by at least 10 times (as ketones usually cause), problems with
        concentration (because human brain is basically made for a high-starch
        diet and doesn't work well without starch), high cholesterol (because
        the fats in coconuts and avocados are for the large part saturated
        fats), and so on. It's a little hard to tell apart fact from fiction
        about whether ketogenic diets help against epilepsy in some patients.
        It's also hard to tell whether there is a time and place for such
        non-science-based treatments. Certainly not as the first resort, or as
        the second or third resort, but maybe as the last resort. But it's not
        at all hard to tell that the idea that we should all be eating a
        ketogenic diet is fiction.<br />

          <i>Robert Atkins</i><br />
        </div>
        In the early 1990s, a physician named Robert Coleman Atkins came up with
        an idea that we should all be eating a diet that's low in carbohydrates,
        but not necessarily low in protein. That's called <i>Atkins diet</i>. He
        came up with the idea that starch, along with sugar, is to be blamed for
        many diseases. In other words, that we should be eating a meat-based
        diet. Of course, physiologically, blaming starch for diabetes makes
        about as much sense saying that the cholesterol you eat is to be blamed
        for heart disease. Most of the cholesterol in your blood is produced by
        your liver in response to saturated fats, and that's especially true if
        you have high cholesterol. And some cholesterol is produced in response
        to fructose, very little of it is the cholesterol you eat. The same is
        true for glucose: the dangerous spike in glucose levels after eating
        sugar is not caused by the glucose in sugar, it's caused by the fructose
        in sugar making your liver behave as if your glucose levels were much
        lower than they actually are, and mistakenly convert glycogen and
        protein into glucose. Starch doesn't contain fructose. In fact, of foods
        that are commonly eaten, only sugar and honey contain large amounts of
        fructose. Saturated fat also slightly raises the glucose levels in your
        blood, possibly more than starch.<br />
        In spite of the fact that the Atkins'es ideas weren't well-received by
        the experts, and the fact that Atkins soon died from heart attack
        (probably caused by his diet), his ideas actually got rather popular
        among the American public. There still are quite a few popular bloggers
        that advocate meat-based diets. I am going to respond to the arguments
        against vegetarianism made by the blogger DietDoctor
        <a
          href="https://www.dietdoctor.com/health-review-health-claims-backed-no-solid-evidence"

        >. Here we go:
        <p class="quotation">
          No human population in the history of civilization has ever been
          recorded surviving on a vegan diet.
        </p>
        Even if that is true (and not everybody would
        <a
          href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-okinawa-diet-living-to-100/"
          >agree</a
        >
        with that), that's using a soft science to contradict a hard one. You
        don't use some empirical science to contradict mathematics, you don't
        use astronomy to contradict particle physics, you don't use biology to
        contradict chemistry, and you don't use anthropology to contradict
        nutritional science.<br />
        Besides, it works both ways. Has there ever been a society which ate a
        ketogenic diet? You advocate eating coconuts and avocados, does that
        have a long tradition?
        <p class="quotation">
          The vegan diet is nutritionally insufficient, lacking not only vitamin
          B12 but deficient in heme iron and folate (meaning that we should
          refer to it always as a &quot;vegan diet plus supplements&quot;).
        </p>
        This coming from somebody who advocates a ketogenic diet... &#128513;
        Tell me, where would you get vitamin C on a ketogenic diet? From
        supplements, right? If the vegan diet is to be blamed for vitamin B12
        deficiency in the developed world, then so is the low-carb craze to be
        blamed for the recent rise in scurvy in the developed world. WebMD,
        which I see no reason to think is biased, does

          >that</a
        >. Food from which people used to get vitamin C, such as potato and
        orange juice, is now being demonized, and this affects the way people
        eat, mostly negatively.<br />
        B12 deficiency has more to do with people living in more sterile
        environments than with the diet. It's raising around the world, together
        with the meat consumption. The danger of getting infected with bacteria
        from plants is way greater than the danger of B12 deficiency, so we kill
        the bacteria that produce B12 in the plants we eat.<br />
        Oh, and, heme iron? &#128533; As far as I know, according to the
        mainstream nutrition, heme iron is the bad form of iron that causes
        colon cancer. Why it is that so many studies show red meat causes
        cancer, but that white meat and fish doesn't? The main difference
        between them is, well, the heme iron.<br />
        A common claim by those who advocate meat-based diets is that
        micronutrients are supposedly better absorbed from meat than from
        plants. Well, I see no reason to think that's the case, other than the
        bias. It's well-known rabbit meat takes more vitamins to digest than
        what can be absorbed from it. While it's true that most plants
        containing calcium contain oxalates (preventing calcium from getting
        absorbed), calcium in milk gets absorbed... into blood, but not in the
        bones (for cow's milk contains little to no vitamin K, because cows can
        synthesize it themselves), and it's possible if not probable that it
        causes heart disease in humans. Another common argument is that DHA (the
        form of omega-3-acids found in meat) protects against heart disease
        better than ALA (the form of omega-3-acids found in plants). But, here
        is a thing, there is no evidence either protect against heart disease.
        <p class="quotation">
          A near-vegan diet, in rigorous clinical trials, invariably causes
          HDL-cholesterol to drop and sometimes raises triglycerides, which are
          both signs of worsening heart attack risk.
        </p>
        The idea that HDL protects against heart disease is a new one and is not
        really supported by science. We have a way to, to simplify, turn LDL
        cholesterol into HDL cholesterol and it's called omega-3-acids. Yet,
        studies repeatedly fail to prove omega-3-acids protect against heart
        disease. If omega-3-acids don't help, then moderate drinking (moderate
        amounts of alcohol raise the HDL but not LDL) doesn't help either, and
        saturated fats are certainly harmful.<br />
        Besides, why do you think clinical trials are the most rigorous form of
        nutritional science? The most rigorous form of nutritional science is
        obviously mechanicistic evidence, taking knowledge from harder sciences
        and applying it to nutritional science. But you clearly don't value
        that, since mechanicistic evidence is clearly against your claim that
        starch is to be blamed for various illnesses of today.<br />
        Besides, there are both <i>rigorous</i> clinical trials that suggest
        meat-based diets help against type-2-diabetes, and there are also
        equally <i>rigorous</i> clinical trials, often cited by Neal Barnard,
        which suggest a low-fat high-sugar diet helps against type-2-diabetes.
        That strongly suggests <i>rigorous clinical trial</i> means little to
        nothing when it comes to nutrition (at least partly because they, unlike
        in medicine, can't be properly blinded). And using that phrase
        <i>rigorous clinical trials</i> when it comes to nutrition is quite
        emotionally abusing to people like me.<br />
        There is a time and place for nutritional studies, when something can't
        be determined with data from harder sciences. For example, you can't
        determine, using only harder sciences, what usually happens when people
        go vegetarian, for example, whether many vegetarians replace meat with
        sugar, butter or coconuts (all worse than sometimes eating meat). Let's
        face it, most people are uninformed about healthy eating, even
        significantly misinformed, or simply don't care (they think
        diet-preventable diseases won't happen to <i>them</i>). Attempting to
        determine that with nutritional studies has some merit. Attempting to
        contradict much of what we know about physiology with nutritional
        studies supposedly showing saturated fat don't cause heart disease or
        that sugar doesn't cause diabetes doesn't have a lot of merit.
        <p class="quotation">
          Over the last 30 years, as rates of obesity and diabetes have risen
          sharply in the U.S., the consumption of animal foods has declined
          steeply: whole milk is down 79%; red meat by 28% and beef by 35%; eggs
          are down by 13% and animal fats are down by 27%.<br />
          Meanwhile, consumption of fruits is up by 35% and vegetables by 20%.
          All trends therefore point towards Americans shifting from an
          animal-based diet to a plant-based one, and this data contradict the
          idea that a continued shift towards plant-based foods will promote
          health.
        </p>
        And almost the same argument is used by those who claim sugar doesn't
        cause diabetes,
        <a href="https://www.pcrm.org/news/blog/does-sugar-cause-diabetes"
          >here</a
        >:
        <p class="quotation" style="background: #ffccaa">
          It has become fashionable in recent years to blame sugar for many
          health problems. However, per capita sugar consumption has actually
          been falling in the United States since 1999, when bottled water and
          sugar-free beverages began to edge sodas off the shelf.
        </p>
        So, by the laws of logic, either both of them are right, or none of them
        are right. I don't know how somebody who has studied nutrition or
        something related to that can find those arguments convincing, to me it
        seems worse than the anti-vaccination nonsense.<br />First of all, how
        did you acquire those numbers? They seem wildly wrong. I don't know
        about America, but, in Croatia, in the 1990s (30 years ago), there was a
        bad food shortage (it was war time). And it was easier to survive on a
        village because you could grow your own fruits and vegetables.
        Home-grown fruits and vegetables made most of the diet for most of the
        people. Eggs being down is believable, since many people in the 1990s
        were having backyard chickens, but fruits and vegetables being up or red
        meat being down really isn't plausible.<br />
        Second, even if this is true, this ignores the even-more-obvious
        long-term trend. You know how the emperor Hui Jin was talking
        <i>If they have no rice, let them eat meat.</i> and was thrown out of
        power because of insulting his own people like that? Or when Marie
        Antoinette was talking <i>If they have no bread, let them eat cake.</i>?
        <p style="text-align: center">

          />
        </p>
        Third, even if there were no obvious long-term trend, it would still be
        the anti-vaccination level nonsense of
        <i
          >The rise of autism around the world appears to be correlated with the
          rise of vaccination.</i
        >. Correlation does not imply causation. The reason autism is on the
        rise is that women today give birth when they are older and women who
        give birth older have a greater chance of having a child with autism or
        other congenital complications. Similarly, people long ago didn't live
        long enough to get type-2-diabetes or heart disease, people who would
        have gotten type-2-diabetes or heart disease simply died of other
        illnesses while they were young.

          There's the entire Indian subcontinent, where beef is not eaten by the

        </p>
        And you said you don't like epidemiological studies, but that you only
        take rigorous studies seriously? How about little consistency here?
        &#128528;<br />
        Besides, what's your evidence that total saturated fat intake is lower
        in India than in the US? I see no particular reason to think that's the
        case. The milk intake is about the same.<br />
        <br />
        Nutrition is something we are forced to make decisions about every day.
        Yet, people don't know much about it. And much of what people think they
        know isn't true. Nearly everybody believes rabbits like to eat carrots
        and lettuce, when those are dangerous for rabbits. Nearly everybody
        thinks mice like to eat cheese, when cheese is lethal for mice even in
        small amounts. Nearly everybody thinks spinach is a good source of iron,
        when it isn't (lentil is a far better source). As such, people are
        extremely vulnerable to nutritional pseudoscience.<br />And this really
        makes me question my basic principles. In school, we are taught to value
        free speech. As in, if there is free speech, the information is going to
        overcome all misinformation. But when that doesn't happen? What when, on
        the Internet, you hear nonsense such as
        <i>Sugar doesn't cause diabetes.</i> and
        <i>Saturated fat doesn't cause heart disease.</i>, but you don't hear
        reasonable responses to that? I think that what's going on is that
        nutritionists think they have better things to do than to respond to
        such arguments on the Internet, and that it takes way less effort to
        produce such nonsense than to refute it. We are taught nobody should be
        forcing people to eat in a particular way. But what when there are huge
        externalities to dietary choices people make they are spectacularly
        unaware of? If people choose to eat meat from factory farmed animals,
        there is the huge externality of what the animals have to go through and
        of the antibiotic resistance. Governments don't have an excellent track
        record of basing their beliefs on science, but still they have a way
        better track record than an average person does, and probably any
        particular person does (for they employ experts in various fields).
        Those are really tough questions. On one hand, we are bombarded with
        evidence of a lack of free speech having horrible outcomes (Great Leap
        Forward Famine...). On the other hand, as somebody who has published
        peer-reviewed papers in some sciences, such as
        <a href="toponyms.html">linguistics</a> and
        <a
          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler/raw/master/seminar/seminar.pdf"
          >computer science</a
        >, I know very well that science works precisely because there is a lack
        of complete freedom of speech there: there is a censorship system called
        peer review which prevents bad ideas from being expressed. Maybe there
        is some fundamental difference between government censorship and peer
        review, maybe those who do peer review tend to be much more competent
        than the governments are, and maybe they don't create this
        <i>It's being hidden, so maybe there is something to it.</i> mentality.
        But, still, things like this make me question my core principles. It's a
        tough question whether my libertarianism is compatible with accepting
        science. It's undeniable that government can sometimes make people eat
        more healthy. Before the regulations requiring salt to be iodized,
        thyroid illnesses caused by iodine deficiency were very common, and now
        they are extremely rare. On the other hand, it's also hard to deny
        governments sometimes make things worse. Governments usually subsidize
        milk and sugar industries, and spread the misinformation that sugar and
        milk are harmless in the amounts they are consumed today, when they
        clearly aren't. Also, what we are taught at school about nutrition may
        be worse than useless. After I read my 9th-grade biology textbook, I was
        under the impression that the only thing that raises your cholesterol is
        the cholesterol you eat, when it actually plays very little role. We
        were also taught that refined carbohydrates are to be blamed for the
        rise of type-2-diabetes, when I'm yet to hear a plausible scientific
        explanation of how they can be. We were also taught fructose was
        harmless and glucose was bad, when exactly the opposite is true.<br />

        >Some people might say we don't need blind experiments for that because
        we supposedly know epilepsy doesn't respond well to placebo. Well, first

        it somewhat responds to placebo, about 7% of epileptic patients who
        receive placebo become seizure-free, while only 1.2% of untreated

        thing (if not necessary) even when there is little human factor
        involved. Unblinded and uncontrolled experiment is what convinced

        (a man who robbed a bank with no visible attempt to disguise, thinking
        rubbing his face with a lemon juice, an invisible ink, would make him
        invisible to the cameras) that rubbing his face with lemon juice will
        make him invisible to the cameras. Blinding and controlling the
        experiment (doing it both with water and the lemon juice, photographing
        both times, and wearing glasses so that he can't tell what is lemon
        juice and what is water while rubbing his face in that because of lemon
        burning his eyes and water not as much) would have made it obvious that
        something was wrong with the experimental setup, and the same applies
        here.<br />

        >People who advocate ketogenic diets, as well as other people who
        advocate low-protein diets, often claim it is not the ketosis that
        causes kidney stones in people following low-carbohydrate diets, but too
        much protein. According to them, protein you eat lowers you blood pH,
        which causes your bones to release calcium in an attempt to neutralize
        it. Furthermore, that calcium then goes into your kidneys, causing
        kidney stones. That explanation is not supported by evidence. The most
        obvious problem is that, well, if protein is to be blamed for kidney
        stones... how come do kidney stones appear to form significantly more
        often in people following a ketogenic diet, which restricts protein
        intake? Also, studies find little or no effect of protein on bone
        density. Osteoporosis is much more easily caused by a lack of Vitamin K
        than protein in the diet. Since protein you eat has little to no effect
        on bone density, it will have even less effect on kidney stones. It is
        astonishing how the proponents of diet fads manage to contradict
        mountains of evidence with blind speculation, and how many people end up
        believing them. <br /><br />
