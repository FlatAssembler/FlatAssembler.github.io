        I have been debating various things on Internet forums for almost a
        decade now. And one of the hardest lessons I've learned is not to use
        not even wrong arguments. I want to share that lesson I've learned.<br />
        A significant percentage of the arguments used on the Internet forums
        are not only not right, they are also not even wrong. And while it is
        difficult to tell apart a right argument from a wrong one, it is not all
        that difficult to tell apart not even wrong arguments. Simply, before
        using some phenomenon as an argument against mainstream science, ask
        yourself, how does your &quot;theory&quot; (I am using that word in the
        informal sense.) explain that phenomenon. And if you cannot give a sane
        answer to that question, don't use that argument.<br />
        I know this sounds confusing, so let me illustrate that with an example.
        Here is an example of a not-even-wrong argument:
        <div class="quotation">
          <b>A:</b> If the Earth was round, we would expect the horizon to fall
          as we climb. Furthermore, if ships disappearing bottom first was
          caused by the Earth being round, we would expect the ships to not only
          appear to sink as they go over the horizon, we would also expect them
          to appear to lean. We observe neither of those two things. Therefore,
          the Earth is flat.<br />
          <b>B:</b> I don't understand how the Earth being flat explains those
          two things. If the Earth is flat, what even is the horizon? Why can't
          we see infinitely far away and why do ships disappear bottom first?
          Then we can talk about why the dip of the horizon cannot be perceived
          and why the leaning of the ships as they go over the horizon cannot be
          perceived. I don't see how the Earth being flat and there being
          magical curvings of light explains any of those things.<br />
          <b>A:</b> That's irrelevant.<br />
          (The conversation devolves completely.)
        </div>
        The absurdity of the A's arguments should be apparent. Now, here is an
        example of a wrong argument and how it fares on an Internet forum:
        <div class="quotation">
          <b>A:</b> If the Heliocentricism is true, and the Sun were 150'000'000
          kilometers away from the Earth, we would expect the sunbeams to appear
          parallel when they go through clouds. But they don't appear to be
          parallel.<br />
          <b>B:</b> How does the theory that the Earth is flat actually explain
          that?<br />
          <b>A:</b> Well, by the Sun being around 5'000 kilometers high.<br />
          <b>B:</b> Don't you think an equally good explanation is the
          perspective? That the sunbeams appear to converge for the same reason
          the tracks of the railroad appear to converge when we look at the
          distance, but we know they are in fact parallel?<br />
          <b>A:</b> You can explain it like that when the sun is low in the sky,
          close to the horizon, such as during the sunrise and the sunset. But
          what when the sun is close to zenith, when the sunbeams are almost
          vertical?<br />
          (The conversation about perspective continues.)
        </div>
        I hope you can see why using a wrong argument is much better than using
        a not-even-wrong one. Here are the reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using not-even-wrong arguments is low-effort. Once you are deep into
            some field of science, finding things that the science supposedly
            cannot explain is easy. What's not easy is to find things which are
            difficult to explain by mainstream science, but are trivial to
            explain by an alternative theory. <b>That</b> is what counts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because using not-even-wrong arguments is low-effort, it is rude.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using not-even-wrong arguments deeply poisons the discussion. The
            endless not-even-wrong arguments made by Flat-Earthers might make it
            look to a layman that there are many things which are easier to
            explain if you assume the Earth is flat than if you assume the Earth
            is round. In reality, there seems to be precisely one such thing:
            the sunbeams appearing to converge (It's easier to assume the Sun is
            close than to explain away the optical illusion.). Compared to a
            dozen of observations we can make in everyday life which are easier
            to explain if you assume the Earth is round than if you assume it is
            flat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using not-even-wrong arguments shows that you don't understand the
            very nature of the discussion. The purpose of debating is to find
            out which theory (in the informal sense of the word) has more
            explanatory power. What you are doing with not-even-wrong arguments
            is the opposite of that: You are trying to replace a theory that
            explains at least something with a theory that explains precisely
            nothing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        In case you think I am trying to justify the tu-quoque logical fallacy
        here... Well, in a way I am. I think that, when we are trying to compare
        the explanatory power of two things that claim to be scientific
        theories, tu-quoque argument is justified. When it is not justified is
        when you complain about some problem with somebody's theory, and then he
        complains about an <b>unrelated</b> problem with your theory. I think a
        tu-quoque fallacy would be something like this:
        <div class="quotation">
          <b>B:</b> If the Earth is flat, how it is that we can see different
          stars from different places on Earth?<br />
          <b>A:</b> Well, stars being only 3'000 miles up in the sky would
          provide the same effect as the Earth being a sphere with 6'000
          kilometers radius.<br />
          <b>B:</b> No, it wouldn't provide the same effect. If the reason why
          we can see different stars from different places on Earth was stars
          being close, then the constellations would have different shapes
          depending on where you look at them from. There would be perspective
          distortions and, unless you assume all stars are at the exact same
          height, we would also expect there to be parallaxes. We observe
          neither of those two things.<br />
          <b>A:</b> Well, Heliocentricism suffers from the same problem. Why
          don't constellations have different shapes depending on which time of
          the year we look at them from (as the Earth moves around the Sun)?<br />
          <b>B:</b> That's not the same problem. For Heliocentricism, you can
          assume stars are very far away, so that the parallaxes aren't visible.
        </div>
        Here, A is committing the tu-quoque logical fallacy by, instead of
        responding to the argument, complains about an unrelated problem with
        Heliocentricism.<br/>
Of course, sometimes it's hard to tell what is tu-quoque and what isn't. Proponents of Austrian School of Economics, when you point out to them that many of their teachings are incompatible with basic Game Theory, often respond with: &quot;<i>Well, some teachings of the Keynesian economics are also hard to make compatible with Game Theory.</i>&quot;. Is that a tu-quoque argument? Well, I think it is, primarily because the Keynesian economics is at least trying to be compatible with Game Theory. It's motivated by a problem from Game Theory that is the Paradox of Thrift. The Austrian School of Economics is not even trying to take the basic Game Theory into account. Just like with my alternative interpretation of the Croatian names of places: it's at least trying to be compatible with Information Theory. It's motivated by the fact that it seems to follow from basic Information Theory (Collision Entropy and Birthday Paradox) that this k-r pattern in the Croatian river names (Krka, Krapina, Krbavica, Kravar&scaron;&ccaron;ica, Korana, and two rivers named Kara&scaron;ica) is statistically significant (that its p-value is between 1/300 and 1/17). Whether or not it succeeds at being fully compatible with Information Theory is almost irrelevant so long as mainstream onomastics is not even trying to be.<br /><br />
        And like I've said, there are many widely-used not-even-wrong arguments.
        Here are some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Young-Earth Creationists are sometimes asking evolutionists: "<i
              >How it is that we don't see a new specie of plant or animal pop
              up every now and then?</i
            >". But, hang on a second, Young-Earth Creationists believe that
            4'000 years ago there was a global flood and that only a few
            thousand animals, those that fitted into the Noah's Ark, survived.
            And we know there are millions of species of animals. If the story
            of Noah's Ark is true, wouldn't then we expect there to be new
            species of plants and animals popping up every day?
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i>Atheism cannot account for logical tautologies.</i>&quot;
            And injecting God explains the logical tautologies... how exactly?
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i>Vegetarianism leads to soil depletion.</i>&quot; And having
            hundreds of millions of grain-fed cows solves that problem... how
            exactly? If anything, it makes it worse, right?
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i
              >Vegetarianism is immoral because many rodents are killed in the
              production of grains.</i
            >&quot; Again, having hundreds of millions of grain-fed cows doesn't
            solve that problem, it makes it worse. You might argue that cows
            should be grass-fed, but we need to react to the world as it is, not
            the way it should be.
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i
              >Pacifism is wrong because what if some psychotic leader comes to
              power in a neighbouring country and decides to attack us? Without
              a military, we are screwed.</i
            >&quot; It's amazing to me that people who use that argument do not
            see the corrollary in our domestic politics: What if some psychotic
            leader comes to power <b>here</b> and decides to attack a
            neighbouring country? Aren't then we even more screwed if we have
            military? You might argue that pacifism is difficult to make
            compatible with Game Theory, and that may even be a legitimate
            criticism, but that argument isn't.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anarcho-capitalists are often using this argument: &quot;<i
              >We are living in what is, by many metrics, the best time in human
              history (the most peaceful time in human history, lowest
              inequality by many metrics...), but we don't know exactly what led
              us here. Any large government policy is almost bound to result in
              a regression to the mean.</i
            >&quot;. The implication being, of course: &quot;<i
              >Let's do anarcho-capitalist revolution!</i
            >&quot;. But let's <b>actually</b> think about how good we are
            having it. We are living in a world where almost everybody eats
            eggs, yet we are not having pandemics of superbacteria. Why? Sane
            government regulation, of course. We are living in a world with
            countless ISPs with their own DNS servers, yet the Internet isn't
            paralyzed by denial-of-serice attacks which would be made possible
            by some ISPs incorrectly setting up DNS servers. Why? Sane
            government regulation, of course. When you actually think about it,
            isn't the anarcho-capitalist revolution belonging to the same
            category as poorly-conceived large government policies? Look, I am a
            libertarian. I think that the vast majority of laws we have are
            unnecessary if not outright harmful. I think that regulation should
            be massively reduced compared to the status quo. But it doesn't
            follow that replacing the government with some anarcho-capitalist
            security companies which have no apparent way of enforcing actually
            good laws would be a good thing. How would the laws against the
            misuse of antibiotics in the egg industry be enforced in
            anarcho-capitalism? Anarcho-capitalists, in my experience, have no
            answer to that. And I think that, to everybody who isn't
            indoctrinated into anarcho-capitalism, that argument sounds insane.

            &quot;<i
              >Mainstream medicine is claiming that most cancers are caused by
              random mutations in cells. But if that were true, we would expect
              whales to get cancer far more often than mice do. Yet, they get
              cancer equally often.</i
            >&quot; And an alternative theory explains it... how exactly?

              you need for a job is not the main reason why new computer
              engineers cannot find a job. If it were, we would expect it to
              have been even harder for new engineers to find a job ten years
              ago, when the universities were teaching even less relevant
              skills. But getting a job as a programmer was easy 10 years
              ago.</i
            >&quot;. And an alternative theory explains that... how exactly?

          <li>
            &quot;<i
              >Don't study computer engineering because there is a very good
              chance it will get automated by artificial intelligence.</i
            >&quot; OK, let's think about it for a few seconds. What happens if
            computer engineering gets automated? There seem to really be two
            possibilities. One possibility is that we will be living in some
            kind of a robot utopia where nobody needs to work, and then it
            doesn't matter what you studied at the university. The other
            possibility is that we will be living in some robot distopia, and
            then it especially doesn't matter what you studied at the
            university. That's why we should act as if computer engineering will
            never get automated. There are legitimate arguments against studying
            engineering: a difficult university can easily cost you your mental
            health, the skills you learn there appear to be widely applicable
            but actually are not, that it is a saturated field full of "experts"
            who are not even interested in the subject... But saying that AI
            will take our jobs really isn't one of those legitimate arguments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unfortunately many people say, when arguing for anarchism, stuff
            like: &quot;<i
              >Vaccinating young people against COVID-19 is wrong. There is no
              evidence the vaccines lower the transmission of COVID-19, and
              there is plenty of evidence they damage the heart (causing
              myocarditis way more often than COVID-19 itself does) and are
              about as dangerous for young people as COVID-19 is. Governments
              are reckless murderers of young people.</i
            >&quot;. But how would an anarchy solve that problem? It seems
            obvious to me that vaccines would be tested less in anarchy, rather
            than more. After all, they were tested far less for both efficacy
            and safety in the past, such as during the Polio Pandemic of the
            1950s (Cutter Vaccine Incident), and government regulation made them
            be tested more. <b>If</b> vaccines are unsafe and ineffective, then
            an anarchy would make things worse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many germ theory deniers make arguments such as: &quot;<i
              >Germ theory doesn't really explain zoonotic pandemics, it's
              incompatible with basic genetics. Virus equivalent of mating is
              when a virus has its genes stored on multiple molecules (RNA or
              DNA), two viruses attack the same cell, and gene molecules from
              different viruses accidentally end up in the same capsid (That's
              called genetic reassortment.). But if a virus has jumped from, for
              example, a bat to a human, it can only mate with its close
              relatives. Its distant relatives are left on bats. It should die
              out of inbreeding.</i
            >&quot;. But the terrain theory explains that... how exactly?
            Terrain theory is way more incompatible with genetics because, well,
            we can prove that the germs in the infected organism are not just
            the germs in a healthy organism with a different shape: those two
            germs have different genetic code.

            Far too often, Christians are asking atheists the question &quot;<i
              >What if you are wrong?</i
            >&quot;, also known as the Pascal's Wager. The proper response to
            that question is, like Matt Dillahunty says, &quot;<i
              >That's an interesting question. Have you thought about it? What
              if <b>you</b> are wrong? What if Muslims are right? Or Buddhists?
              Or Hindus? What if none of them are right? What if there is a god,
              but he values intellectual honesty, rather than faith?</i
            >&quot;. Most (if not all) forms of the Cosmological Argument are
            also not even wrong, because, well, injecting God just pushes the
            problem one step further, rather than solving it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Christians are also often telling atheists: &quot;<i
              >The real reason you are an atheist is because you just want to
              keep sinning.</i
            >&quot;. Oh, and Christianity is not a religion for those who want
            to sin? Christianity teaches that a serial killer that repents on
            his deathbed will go to heaven. Sounds to me like a fairytale for a
            donkey who cannot accept his own mortality and who wants to keep
            sinning.
          </li>
          <li>
            People against COVID vaccinations are often using this argument:
            &quot;<i
              >COVID vaccinations cause infertility in women because the spike
              protein is similar to some T-shaped protein in the placenta, so
              the vaccines train the immune system to reject it.</i
            >&quot;. Leaving aside that's not remotely how auto-immune disorders
            work (If they were working that way, we would expect auto-immune
            disorders to become less common now when we are inhaling less dead
            and harmless germs due to hygiene, but they are more common now.),
            not getting vaccinated is going to solve that problem... How
            exactly? It's not, in fact, it would make it worse. Not getting
            vaccinated means getting infected with COVID and having even more
            spike protein in your blood than you would have if you got
            vaccinated.
          </li>
          <li>

              >Austrian School of Economics failed to predict the Great
              Depression. That's why Keynesian economics is better.</i
            >&quot; Sorry, but economists almost never predict economic
            recessions ahead of time. And when they do, they almost always
            severely underestimate them. If some economic theory consistently
            predicted economic recessions ahead of time, that would be a good
            argument for it. But that's very far from reality. There are
            legitimate criticisms of the Austrian Economics, such as that some
            of its teachings don't square well with the Game Theory (a. k. a.
            mathematics). But saying that it doesn't explain the recessions well
            isn't one of them, so long as no economic theory does that.

            Communists using superbacteria as an argument against capitalism.
            Are they under the impression that the Soviet Union didn't have
            factory farms where they were pumping chickens with antibiotics?
          </li>
<li>&quot;<i>Let's ban assault weapons (a loosely defined term meaning guns that allow you to shoot quickly and with high precision) to prevent mass shootings!</i>&quot;. Are people who say those things under the impression that there were no mass shootings before those assault weapons were invented? Look, we can talk about gun control. For example, the Gary Kleck's 1995 study suggests that in only around 20% of defensive gun uses the gun was actually fired. You can argue that it is, considering the game theory, a pretty extraordinary claim: game theory probably predicts that a person experiencing a defensive gun use is likely to try to kill the attacker as soon as possible. You can argue that Gary Kleck is claiming that the behaviour that's the opposite of what the game theory predicts is dominant, and that the evidence does not fit the claim. (Just like the proponents of mainstream onomastics often appear to be assuming that the behaviour of languages that's the opposite from what the information theory predicts is dominant, while providing even less evidence than Gary Kleck provides.) But saying that banning assault weapons would somehow stop mass shootings is a not-even-wrong argument.</li>
          <li>
            Advocates of the minimum wage pointing to the studies supposedly
            showing an increase in minimum wage somewhere hasn't led to an
            increased unemployment. I am sorry, but how do <b>you</b> explain
            that? Do you have an economic theory that predicts that? Thus far,
            nobody has presented a plausible economic theory that predicts that
            even a small increase in minimum wage doesn't increase unemployment.
            And if you say &quot;<i>Keynesian economics predicts that.</i>&quot;,
            then your lack of understanding of economics is so severe that it is
            insulting. Look, I barely got a passing score in my university
            economics course, and even I know that Keynesian economics explains
            the fact that unemployment tends to rise during economic booms by
            what's called &quot;sticky wages&quot;: the idea that prices fall
            down faster than wages do. Try to explain why would a sticky wage
            cause unemployment without implying that government-imposed minimum
            wage also does that. You can't do that, right? So this argument is
            somewhere between a not-even-wrong argument and a strawman.
          </li>
<li>&quot;<i>Government price controls are necessary to prevent people from exploiting the victims of natural disasters by price gouging.</i>&quot;. OK, let's take a moment and try to imagine a situation in which we are supposedly helping by banning price gouging. Suppose there is some kind of a natural disaster where you live and that you are left without electricity. You are helping a diabetic person who needs a fridge for insulin. Or, like me, needs a fridge for injections of Vitamin B12 and the antipsychotic Risperidone (Because Risperidone is prescription medication, you cannot buy it whenever you want. Otherwise a few days without electricity wouldn't be a problem for Risperidone since you only get an injection once a week to once a month, but now it can be a problem. And maybe it would also be a problem if it wasn't prescription medication since, well, then it would likely be expensive. The proper policy here for such drugs is besides the point.). Whatever. You need electricity for something more important than video games or cold beer. Suppose you also happen to have a lot of gasoline or diesel in your household. Naturally, you go out and seek whether somebody is selling a gasoline-powered or a diesel-powered electricity generator, and you find somebody who is selling it. But instead of selling it for 500 euros, he sells it for 700 euros. You wish the price was lower, but then you ask yourself: &quot;<i>If the price was lower, would that electricity generator still be available for sale? Wouldn't then somebody buy it just so they can have cold beer or play video games? Would this guy even have bothered to come into this place stricken by a natural disaster to sell the generator if he wasn't allowed to increase the price?</i>&quot;. Do you see the problem? What's the alternative to price gouging in the event of natural disasters? How else do you increase the probability of the electricity generators going to where they are needed most? Besides, how does the fact that natural disasters are possible justify giving the government the power to price control when there are no natural disasters going on? In praxis, price controls of some cheap form of bread means that, unless you are very lucky to go to a bakery before Hungarians who went here to Donji Miholjac bought all of that cheap bread, you will need to buy a more expensive bread. You are probably paying for bread more than if there were no price controls. Don't you agree? But what makes this argument not-even-wrong is that price gouging appears to be most necessary precisely in the events of natural disasters.</li>
        </ul>
        And so on...<br /><br />
        Let me be clear that I don't think it's always unreasonable to ask a
        question about a supposed problem with mainstream science without
        proposing an actual solution. I think that, in a discussion about the
        Illyrian language, this is an entirely reasonable question: &quot;<i
          >Why isn't the 'p' in 'Colapis' (ancient name for the Kupa river) and
          'Serapia' (ancient name for the Bednja river) geminated, since 'a' was
          short (because -ap- is coming from *h<small><sub>2</sub></small
          >ep meaning 'water')? The 'n' was geminated after a short 'a' in
          'Pannonia' (from *pen meaning 'marsh').</i
        >&quot;. It's probably possible to have a productive conversation about
        that question. What would be not-even-wrong is if somebody was
        attempting to discredit mainstream onomastics with that question without
        providing an alternative etymology to Pannonia (or, less likely, to both
        Colapis and Serapia) that doesn't suffer from the exact same problem.
        Though, for some reason, even
        <a
          href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-p-in-Colapis-ancient-name-for-the-Kupa-river-and-Serapia-ancient-name-for-the-Bednja-river-geminated-since-a-was-short-coming-from-h2ep-The-n-was-geminated-after-a-short-a-in-Pannonia-from-pen-meaning?ch=10&oid=201576068&share=1cbb0840&srid=ul0yA&target_type=question"
          >that question wasn't well-received on Quora</a
        >, presumably because many people misunderstood it as an attempt to
        propagate a not-even-wrong argument.<br />
        And complaining that the mainstream onomastics uses methodology that
        seems to contradict basic information theory, like I'm doing, is not
        not-even-wrong, because I am suggesting a methodology that
        <b>doesn't</b> suffer from the exact same problem. Mainstream onomastics
        claims that this k-r pattern in the Croatian river names (Krka, Korana,
        Kravar&scaron;&ccaron;ica, Krapina, Krbavica, two rivers named
        Kara&scaron;ica) is a coincidence, while basic information theory
        (Collision Entropy and Birthday Paradox) strongly suggests that it's
        statistically significant (that the probability of such a pattern
        occurring by chance is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17). An obvious
        solution is to suppose that this k-r pattern was an Illyrian word for
        &quot;to flow&quot;, or at least some prefix that was, for some reason,
        common in names of rivers. I have a rather detailed explanation of what
        I suppose happened, which you can read
        <a
          href="https://teo-samarzija.users.sourceforge.net/#informatics_to_toponyms"
          >on my website</a
        >.
        <span id="traditional_methods"
          >The responses to that argument saying that we should disregard the
          information theory and rely on "<i>traditional methods</i>" are
          probably not-even-wrong because, well, how do you justify those "<i
            >traditional methods</i
          >" without appealing to the information theory? Traditional methods
          might be viewed as non-math-intensive heuristics, which sometimes
          fail, and that's why we have the math-heavy information theory to
          correct them. In other words, traditional methods only work somewhat
          because information theory works well.</span
        >
        And asking &quot;<i
          >If Illyrian was a satem language, what did Curicum, the ancient name
          for Krk (the northernmost big island in the Adriatic sea), mean?</i
        >&quot; is not not-even-wrong, because there is quite an obvious
        explanation if you assume Illyrian was a centum language: Curicum comes
        from Indo-European *<i>(s)k<sup>j</sup>eh<sub>1</sub>weros</i> (northern
        wind). The difference between the examples of not-even-wrong arguments
        and the arguments I am using against mainstream onomastics should really
        be apparent.<br /><br />
        I hope I've made the Internet a better place by making this web-page.
        Link to it when somebody is using not-even-wrong arguments! But keep in
        mind that, in the minds of those who are using not-even-wrong arguments,
        they are the ones who are following logic. When I was using that
        argument with the horizon appearing to rise with us as we climb, I
        thought it was a <i>modus tollens</i> and therefore a rational argument.
        A little knowledge of logic is worse than none.<br />
        I suppose that many people who are using not-even-wrong arguments also
        don't understand what "explaining" means. When we say some theory
        explains something, we mean that it more-or-less predicts those things.
        The Round-Earth Theory clearly predicts that the horizon will be visible
        as a straight line that is below one's eye-level at the angle of:
        <img
          src="https://flatassembler.github.io/formula.png"
          style="vertical-align: middle"
        />, where r is the radius of the Earth and h is the elevation of the
        observer. And this is approximately what we see. Flat-Earth Theory, on
        the other hand, doesn't predict anything about the horizon. Just about
        any observation we can imagine (the horizon being below one's eye level,
        the horizon being at the eye level, the horizon being above one's eye
        level...) can be shoehorned equally well into the Earth being flat and
        there being magical curvings of light. That's why we say that the
        Flat-Earth Theory doesn't explain those things.<br /><br />

        UPDATE on 05/05/2025: I've been thinking about this recently, is looking
        for not-even-wrong arguments a better strategy to detect pseudoscience
        than looking for ad-hoc hypotheses is? I think it is. I think that,
        without deeper analysis, an average person is not capable of telling
        apart even the most blatant ad-hoc hypotheses. For instance, back when I
        was a Flat-Earther, I didn't realize that &quot;<i
          >Ships disappearing bottom first is an illusion caused by waves.</i
        >&quot; is a blatant ad-hoc hypothesis. I didn't do the mathematics to
        realize that, unless you are assuming there is something weird going on
        with light, the waves would need to be higher than your eye-level for
        that to happen. Similarly with linguistics. One of the first responses I
        got when presenting
        <a
          href="https://teo-samarzija.users.sourceforge.net/#informatics_to_toponyms"
          >the argument I presented in my text
          <i>Etimologija Kara&scaron;ica</i></a
        >
        on an Internet forum was: &quot;<i
          >Maybe the nouns in the Croatian language have lower collision entropy
          than the rest of the words in the Aspell word-list for the Croatian
          language.</i
        >&quot;. And, in my experience, people, even intelligent people, don't
        tend to immediately realize why that's an absurd thing to say: That's
        perhaps how the Swahili grammar works, where nouns can only start with
        one of the 18 prefixes called noun classes, whereas verbs can start with
        whatever consonant cluster the phonotactics allows, but there is nothing
        like that in the Croatian grammar. Not to mention it makes calculations
        much more complicated (thus running against the Occam's Razor). One
        probably needs to do mathematics to realize that. On the other hand, I
        think any layman can realize when somebody is making a bunch of
        not-even-wrong arguments: When somebody is collecting things mainstream
        science supposedly cannot explain, without providing a sane explanation
        for those same things. And not-even-wrong arguments are still a smoking
        gun of pseudoscience, just like ad-hoc hypotheses are.
