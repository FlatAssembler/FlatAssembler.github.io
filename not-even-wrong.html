        I have been debating various things on Internet forums for almost a
        decade now. And one of the hardest lessons I've learned is not to use
        not even wrong arguments. I want to share that lesson I've learned.<br />
        A significant percentage of the arguments used on the Internet forums
        are not only not right, they are also not even wrong. And while it is
        difficult to tell apart a right argument from a wrong one, it is not all
        that difficult to tell apart not even wrong arguments. Simply, before
        using some phenomenon as an argument against mainstream science, ask
        yourself, how does your &quot;theory&quot; (I am using that word in the
        informal sense.) explain that phenomenon. And if you cannot give a sane
        answer to that question, don't use that argument.<br />
        I know this sounds confusing, so let me illustrate that with an example.
        Here is an example of a not-even-wrong argument:
        <div class="quotation">
          <b>A:</b> If the Earth was round, we would expect the horizon to fall
          as we climb. Furthermore, if ships disappearing bottom first was
          caused by the Earth being round, we would expect the ships to not only
          appear to sink as they go over the horizon, we would also expect them
          to appear to lean. We observe neither of those two things. Therefore,
          the Earth is flat.<br />
          <b>B:</b> I don't understand how the Earth being flat explains those
          two things. If the Earth is flat, what even is the horizon? Why can't
          we see infinitely far away and why do ships disappear bottom first?
          Then we can talk about why the dip of the horizon cannot be perceived
          and why the leaning of the ships as they go over the horizon cannot be
          perceived. I don't see how the Earth being flat and there being
          magical curvings of light explains any of those things.<br />
          <b>A:</b> That's irrelevant.<br />
          (The conversation devolves completely.)
        </div>
        The absurdity of the A's arguments should be apparent. Now, here is an
        example of a wrong argument and how it fares on an Internet forum:
        <div class="quotation">
          <b>A:</b> If the Heliocentricism is true, and the Sun were 150'000'000
          kilometers away from the Earth, we would expect the sunbeams to appear
          parallel when they go through clouds. But they don't appear to be
          parallel.<br />
          <b>B:</b> How does the theory that the Earth is flat actually explain
          that?<br />
          <b>A:</b> Well, by the Sun being around 5'000 kilometers high.<br />
          <b>B:</b> Don't you think an equally good explanation is the
          perspective? That the sunbeams appear to converge for the same reason
          the tracks of the railroad appear to converge when we look at the
          distance, but we know they are in fact parallel?<br />
          <b>A:</b> You can explain it like that when the sun is low in the sky,
          close to the horizon, such as during the sunrise and the sunset. But
          what when the sun is close to zenith, when the sunbeams are almost
          vertical?<br />
          (The conversation about perspective continues.)
        </div>
        I hope you can see why using a wrong argument is much better than using
        a not-even-wrong one. Here are the reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using not-even-wrong arguments is low-effort. Once you are deep into
            some field of science, finding things that the science supposedly
            cannot explain is easy. What's not easy is to find things which are
            difficult to explain by mainstream science, but are trivial to
            explain by an alternative theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because using not-even-wrong arguments is low-effort, it is rude.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using not-even-wrong arguments deeply poisons the discussion. The
            endless not-even-wrong arguments made by Flat-Earthers might make it
            look to a layman that there are many things which are easier to
            explain if you assume the Earth is flat than if you assume the Earth
            is round. In reality, there seems to be precisely one such thing:
            the sunbeams appearing to converge (It's easier to assume the Sun is
            close than to explain away the optical illusion.). Compared to a
            dozen of observations we can make in everyday life which are easier
            to explain if you assume the Earth is round than if you assume it is
            flat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using not-even-wrong arguments shows that you don't understand the
            very nature of the discussion. The purpose of debating is to find
            out which theory (in the informal sense of the word) has more
            explanatory power. What you are doing with not-even-wrong arguments
            is the opposite of that: You are trying to replace a theory that
            explains at least something with a theory that explains precisely
            nothing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        In case you think I am trying to justify the tu-quoque logical fallacy
        here... Well, in a way I am. I think that, when we are trying to compare
        the explanatory power of two things that claim to be scientific
        theories, tu-quoque argument is justified. When it is not justified is
        when you complain about some problem with somebody's theory, and then he
        complains about an <b>unrelated</b> problem with your theory. I think a
        tu-quoque fallacy would be something like this:
        <div class="quotation">
          <b>B:</b> If the Earth is flat, how it is that we can see different
          stars from different places on Earth?<br />
          <b>A:</b> Well, stars being only 3'000 miles up in the sky would
          provide the same effect as the Earth being a sphere with 6'000
          kilometers radius.<br />
          <b>B:</b> No, it wouldn't provide the same effect. If the reason why
          we can see different stars from different places on Earth was stars
          being close, then the constellations would have different shapes
          depending on where you look at them from. There would be perspective
          distortions and, unless you assume all stars are at the exact same
          height, we would also expect there to be parallaxes. We observe
          neither of those two things.<br />
          <b>A:</b> Well, Heliocentricism suffers from the same problem. Why
          don't constellations have different shapes depending on which time of
          the year we look at them from (as the Earth moves around the Sun)?<br />
          <b>B:</b> That's not the same problem. For Heliocentricism, you can
          assume stars are very far away, so that the parallaxes aren't visible.
        </div>
        Here, A is committing the tu-quoque logical fallacy by, instead of
        responding to the argument, complains about an unrelated problem with
        Heliocentricism.<br /><br />
        And like I've said, there are many widely-used not-even-wrong arguments.
        Here are some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Young-Earth Creationists are sometimes asking evolutionists: "<i
              >How it is that we don't see a new specie of plant or animal pop
              up every now and then?</i
            >". But, hang on a second, Young-Earth Creationists believe that
            4'000 years ago there was a global flood and that only a few
            thousand animals, those that fitted into the Noah's Ark, survived.
            And we know there are millions of species of animals. If the story
            of Noah's Ark is true, wouldn't then we expect there to be new
            species of plants and animals popping up every day?
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i>Atheism cannot account for logical tautologies.</i>&quot;
            And injecting God explains the logical tautologies... how exactly?
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i>Vegetarianism leads to soil depletion.</i>&quot; And having
            hundreds of millions of grain-fed cows solves that problem... how
            exactly? If anything, it makes it worse, right?
          </li>
<li>&quot;<i>Vegetarianism is immoral because many rodents are killed in the production of grains.</i>&quot; Again, having hundreds of millions of grain-fed cows doesn't solve that problem, it makes it worse. you might argue that cows should be grass-fed, but we need to react to the world as it is, not the way it should be.</li>
<li>&quot;<i>Pacifism is wrong because what if some psychotic leader comes to power in a neighbouring country? Without a military, we are screwed.</i>&quot; It's amazing to me that people who use that argument do not see the corrollary in our domestic politics: What if some psychotic leader comes to power <b>here</b> and decides to attack a neighbouring country?</li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i
              >Mainstream medicine is claiming that most cancers are caused by
              random mutations in cells. But if that were true, we would expect
              whales to get cancer far more often than mice do. Yet, they get
              cancer equally often.</i
            >&quot; And an alternative theory explains it... how exactly?
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i
              >Most of the climate models predict the infra-red (long-wave)
              radiation from the Earth will decrease because of the greenhouse
              effect. Yet the satellite data shows it's been increasing. What's
              the point of trusting climate models then about the effect of CO2
              on the global temperature?</i
            >&quot; And an alternative theory explains that rise of infra-red
            radiation... how exactly?
          </li>
          <li>
            &quot;<i
              >The skills-gap theory of why recently graduated computer
              engineers cannot find a job these days is nonsense. The gap
              between the skills the university equips you with and the skills
              you need for a job is not the main reason why new computer
              engineers cannot find a job. If it were, we would expect it to
              have been even harder for new engineers to find a job ten years
              ago, when the universities were teaching even less relevant
              skills. But getting a job as a programmer was easy 10 years
              ago.</i
            >&quot;. And an alternative theory explains that... how exactly?
          </li>
          <li>
            Or unfortunately many people say, when arguing for anarchism, stuff
            like: &quot;<i
              >Vaccinating young people against COVID-19 is wrong. There is no
              evidence the vaccines lower the transmission of COVID-19, and
              there is plenty of evidence they damage the heart (causing
              myocarditis way more often than COVID-19 itself does) and are
              about as dangerous for young people as COVID-19 is. Governments
              are reckless murderers of young people.</i
            >&quot;. But how would an anarchy solve that problem? It seems
            obvious to me that vaccines would be tested less in anarchy, rather
            than more. After all, they were tested far less for both efficacy
            and safety in the past, such as during the Polio Pandemic of the
            1950s (Cutter Vaccine Incident), and government regulation made them
            be tested more. <b>If</b> vaccines are unsafe and ineffective, then
            an anarchy would make things worse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many germ theory deniers make arguments such as: &quot;<i
              >Germ theory doesn't really explain zoonotic pandemics, it's
              incompatible with basic genetics. Virus equivalent of mating is
              when a virus has its genes stored on multiple molecules (RNA or
              DNA), two viruses attack the same cell, and gene molecules from
              different viruses accidentally end up in the same capsid (That's
              called genetic reassortment.). But if a virus has jumped from, for
              example, a bat to a human, it can only mate with its close
              relatives. Its distant relatives are left on bats. It should die
              out of inbreeding.</i
            >&quot;. But the terrain theory explains that... how exactly?
            Terrain theory is way more incompatible with genetics because, well,
            we can prove that the germs in the infected organism are not just
            the germs in a healthy organism with a different shape: those two
            germs have different genetic code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Far too often, Christians are asking atheists the question &quot;<i
              >What if you are wrong?</i
            >&quot;, also known as the Pascal's Wager. The proper response to
            that question is, like Matt Dillahunty says, &quot;<i
              >That's an interesting question. Have you thought about it? What
              if <b>you</b> are wrong? What if Muslims are right? Or Buddhists?
              Or Hindus? What if none of them are right? What if there is a god,
              but he values intellectual honesty, rather than faith?</i
            >&quot;. Most (if not all) forms of the Cosmological Argument are
            also not even wrong, because, well, injecting God just pushes the
            problem one step further, rather than solving it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Christians are also often telling atheists: &quot;<i
              >The real reason you are an atheist is because you just want to
              keep sinning.</i
            >&quot;. Oh, and Christianity is not a religion for those who want
            to sin? Christianity teaches that a serial killer that repents on
            his deathbed will go to heaven. Sounds to me like a fairytale for a
            donkey who cannot accept his own mortality and who wants to keep
            sinning.
          </li>
          <li>
            People against COVID vaccinations are often using this argument:
            &quot;<i
              >COVID vaccinations cause infertility in women because the spike
              protein is similar to some T-shaped protein in the placenta, so
              the vaccines train the immune system to reject it.</i
            >&quot;. Leaving aside that's not remotely how auto-immune disorders
            work (If they were working that way, we would expect auto-immune
            disorders to become less common now when we are inhaling less dead
            and harmless germs due to hygiene, but they are more common now.),
            not getting vaccinated is going to solve that problem... How
            exactly? It's not, in fact, it would make it worse. Not getting
            vaccinated means getting infected with COVID and having even more
            spike protein in your blood than you would have if you got
            vaccinated.
          </li>
<li>&quot;<i>Austrian School of Economics failed to predict the Great Depression. That's why Keynesian economics is better.</i>&quot; Sorry, but economists almost never predict economic recessions ahead of time. And when they do, they almost always severely undersestimate them. If some economic theory consistently predicted economic recessions ahead of time, that would be a good argument for it. But that's very far from reality. There are legitimate criticisms of the Austrian Economics, such as that some of its teachings don't square well with the Game Theory (a. k. a. mathematics). But saying that it doesn't explain the recessions well isn't one of them.</li>
        </ul>
        And so on...<br /><br />
        Let me be clear that I don't think it's always unreasonable to ask a
        question about a supposed problem with mainstream science without
        proposing an actual solution. I think that, in a discussion about the
        Illyrian language, this is an entirely reasonable question: &quot;<i
          >Why isn't the 'p' in 'Colapis' (ancient name for the Kupa river) and
          'Serapia' (ancient name for the Bednja river) geminated, since 'a' was
          short (because -ap- is coming from *h<small><sub>2</sub></small
          >ep meaning 'water')? The 'n' was geminated after a short 'a' in
          'Pannonia' (from *pen meaning 'marsh').</i
        >&quot;. It's probably possible to have a productive conversation about
        that question. What would be not-even-wrong is if somebody was
        attempting to discredit mainstream onomastics with that question without
        providing an alternative etymology to Pannonia (or, less likely, to both
        Colapis and Serapia) that doesn't suffer from the exact same problem.<br />
        And complaining that the mainstream onomastics uses methodology that
        seems to contradict basic information theory, like I'm doing, is not
        not-even-wrong, because I am suggesting a methodology that
        <b>doesn't</b> suffer from the exact same problem. Mainstream onomastics
        claims that this k-r pattern in the Croatian river names (Krka, Korana,
        Kravar&scaron;&ccaron;ica, Krapina, Krbavica, two rivers named
        Kara&scaron;ica) is a coincidence, while basic information theory
        (Collision Entropy and Birthday Paradox) strongly suggests that it's
        statistically significant (that the probability of such a pattern
        occurring by chance is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17). An obvious
        solution is to suppose that this k-r pattern was an Illyrian word for
        &quot;to flow&quot;, or at least some prefix that was, for some reason,
        common in names of rivers. I have a rather detailed explanation of what
        I suppose happened, which you can read
        <a
          href="https://teo-samarzija.users.sourceforge.net/#informatics_to_toponyms"
          >on my website</a
        >. Asking &quot;<i
          >If Illyrian was a satem language, what did Curicum, the ancient name
          for Krk (the northernmost big island in the Adriatic sea), mean?</i
        >&quot; is not not-even-wrong, because there is quite an obvious
        explanation if you assume Illyrian was a centum language: Curicum comes
        from Indo-European *<i>(s)k<sup>j</sup>eh<sub>1</sub>weros</i> (northern
        wind). The difference between the examples of not-even-wrong arguments
        and the arguments I am using against mainstream onomastics should really
        be apparent.<br /><br />
        I hope I've made the Internet a better place by making this web-page.
        Link to it when somebody is using not-even-wrong arguments! But keep in
        mind that, in the minds of those who are using not-even-wrong arguments,
        they are the ones who are following logic. When I was using that
        argument with the horizon appearing to rise with us as we climb, I
        thought it was a <i>modus tollens</i> and therefore a rational argument.
        A little knowledge of logic is worse than none.<br />
        I suppose that many people who are using not-even-wrong arguments also
        don't understand what "explaining" means. When we say some theory
        explains something, we mean that it more-or-less predicts those things.
        The Round-Earth Theory clearly predicts that the horizon will be visible
        as a straight line that is below one's eye-level at the angle of:
        <img
          src="https://flatassembler.github.io/formula.png"
          style="vertical-align: middle"
        />, where r is the radius of the Earth and h is the elevation of the
        observer. And this is approximately what we see. Flat-Earth Theory, on
        the other hand, doesn't predict anything about the horizon. Just about
        any observation we can imagine (the horizon being below one's eye level,
        the horizon being at the eye level, the horizon being above one's eye
        level...) can be shoehorned equally well into the Earth being flat and
        there being magical curvings of light. That's why we say that the
        Flat-Earth Theory doesn't explain those things.<br /><br />

        UPDATE on 05/05/2025: I've been thinking about this recently, is looking
        for not-even-wrong arguments a better strategy to detect pseudoscience
        than looking for ad-hoc hypotheses is? I think it is. I think that,
        without deeper analysis, an average person is not capable of telling
        apart even the most blatant ad-hoc hypotheses. For instance, back when I
        was a Flat-Earther, I didn't realize that &quot;<i
          >Ships disappearing bottom first is an illusion caused by waves.</i
        >&quot; is a blatant ad-hoc hypothesis. I didn't do the mathematics to
        realize that, unless you are assuming there is something weird going on
        with light, the waves would need to be higher than your eye-level for
        that to happen. Similarly with linguistics. One of the first responses I
        got when presenting
        <a
          href="https://teo-samarzija.users.sourceforge.net/#informatics_to_toponyms"
          >the argument I presented in my text
          <i>Etimologija Kara&scaron;ica</i></a
        >
        on an Internet forum was: &quot;<i
          >Maybe the nouns in the Croatian language have lower collision entropy
          than the rest of the words in the Aspell word-list for the Croatian
          language.</i
        >&quot;. And, in my experience, people, even intelligent people, don't
        tend to immediately realize why that's an absurd thing to say: That's
        perhaps how the Swahili grammar works, where nouns can only start with
        one of the 18 prefixes called noun classes, whereas verbs can start with
        whatever consonant cluster the phonotactics allows, but there is nothing
        like that in the Croatian grammar. Not to mention it makes calculations
        much more complicated (thus running against the Occam's Razor). One
        probably needs to do mathematics to realize that. On the other hand, I
        think any layman can realize when somebody is making a bunch of
        not-even-wrong arguments: When somebody is collecting things mainstream
        science supposedly cannot explain, without providing a sane explanation
        for those same things. And not-even-wrong arguments are still a smoking
        gun of pseudoscience, just like ad-hoc hypotheses are.
