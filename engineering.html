        I've noticed that, quite often, when discussing politics, people are
        proposing solutions that would be huge engineering challenges to
        implement. I think that's not a right thing to do, I think that
        political proposals should be possible to implement here and now, rather
        than in some distant future.

          >My fellow libertarians are not immune to this fallacy either</a
        >. I will illustrate what I mean by some examples:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >People proposing powering the national grid with renewable energy
              sources.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, that's a huge engineering problem for two reasons:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Unlike the traditional energy sources where we can control
                exactly how much power we are producing, renewable energy
                sources don't allow us to do that. How much energy wind turbine
                produces depends a lot on how fast the wind is blowing. If the
                wind slows down two times, the energy the wind turbine produce
                decreases 8 times, because the wind energy is proportional to
                the cube of the speed. Similarly, solar panels don't produce
                energy during the night, right when we need the energy the most.
                We would need to store electricity, and that's a huge
                engineering challenge.
              </li>
              <li>
                Solar energy is very different from the forms of energy we are
                used to, because it generates direct current (rather than
                alternating current, as traditional sources of energy do) and it
                generates constant current rather than constant voltage.
                Connecting solar panels to a national grid is an electrical and
                electronic engineering nightmare.
              </li>
            </ol>
            In spite of all of this, people still tend to think the barriers to
            powering our national grid with renewable sources are mostly
            political in nature. I see no reason to think that's the case.

              >Anarchists are often implying the Internet could work in an
              anarchy.</b
            ><br />
            Internet as we know it couldn't work without government regulation,
            and there are many reasons for that. For example, without government
            regulation, many ISPs would probably set up their DNS servers
            improperly, to respond to requests from all IP addresses rather than
            just to the IP addresses they are supposed to serve. And, since DNS
            servers often respond with huge responses to short queries, that
            would make it trivial to implement large-scale denial-of-service
            attacks which would paralyze the Internet. Perhaps you could somehow
            pass a law that bans unencrypted DNS and requires everybody to use
            DNS-over-HTTPS, but how exactly would you enforce that law? Set up
            deep-packet-inspection middle-boxes everywhere which would filter
            unencrypted DNS? Wouldn't that slow down the Internet a lot?
            Besides, how do you make all the devices connected to the Internet
            compatible with DNS-over-HTTPS? And so on... And in case you think
            that is a self-solving problem because the Internet will, over time,
            naturally switch to using DNS-over-HTTPS, well, I think the Internet
            of the near future will be even more vulnerable to such attacks than
            the Internet of today is. If the current trends continue, there will
            be a widespread adoption of HTTP 3 and other QUIC-based protocols.
            And, since QUIC is based on UDP rather than TCP, there are no TCP
            handshakes inherent in it to prevent IP spoofing attacks. QUIC does
            have its own ways of preventing IP spoofing attacks, but those take
            extra processing power. In an anarchy, what will force the Internet
            hosting providers (Hostinger...) that, if they support HTTP 3, they
            implement it properly? An improperly set up HTTP 3 server (that
            doesn't properly verify whether the handshake has been done
            correctly or that doesn't check whether the session of some request
            has expired before responding to it) can be used to implement a
            DNS-reflection-like attack on steroids. I say "on steroids" because
            HTTP 3, unlike DNS, has no limit as to how many UDP packets a
            response might contain. Internet in an anarchy, if possible at all,
            would be a huge engineering challenge.

            <b>People proposing that cows should be grass-fed.</b><br />
            Well, there is a problem with that proposal: Grass-fed cows emit
            around three times as much methane per a litre of milk than
            grain-fed cows (<i
              >UPDATE: OK, maybe that statistic isn't accurate. I've written
              about it
              <a href="factory_farming#second_argument">elsewhere on my blog</a

              emit more methane per a litre of milk than grain-fed cows.</i
            >). Now, some people are aware of that problem, and they respond
            with something like: &quot;<i
              >Well, there are bacteria in kangaroos that digest cellulose but
              emit a few times less methane than the bacteria in the cows that
              do that. Perhaps we could somehow genetically modify the bacteria
              in the cows to do the same thing.</i
            >&quot;. Do I even need to point out the problems with that? Like,
            do you have a solution that works now, or do you have a solution
            that might work centuries into the future?

              >People saying that lab-grown animal products will soon solve the
              problem of superbacteria.</b
            ><br />
            I am sorry to burst your bubble, but they won't. Most of the
            antibiotics these days is being used in the egg industry (<i
              >UPDATE: I've seen some people say that the statistics suggesting
              most antibiotics are being used in the egg industry are
              inaccurate, and that most antibiotics are being used for cows and
              pigs. I am quite sure that's false as 45% of antibiotics used in
              agriculture are ionophores, that is, antibiotics which are
              effective in birds but not in mammals. I think that therefore any
              estimate that puts the proportion of antibiotics used in the egg
              industry to be below 50% is not credible.</i
            >), and we won't have lab-grown eggs any time soon. We struggle to
            produce muscle meat in a lab, and eggs are far more complicated than
            muscles. Government regulation of the egg industry is a far more
            realistic solution to the problem of superbacteria than lab-grown
            animal products.

            ><br />
            Sorry, that's just not how computers work. Backdoors in electronic
            devices will make it significantly easier for hackers to read our
            data, and therefore very likely make us significantly less safe.
            Besides, what about other countries, whose government cannot really
            be trusted to use the information to serve the public good?
          </li>
        </ol>
        Overall, I think the simplest explanation for most of the people using
        such arguments is ignorance. For the fourth example, I suppose most of
        the people who say that honestly believe that a significant percentage
        of antibiotics goes to cows and pigs, and that lab-grown meat will soon
        solve that problem. For the second example, I suppose that many people
        indeed don't understand how the Internet works well enough to understand
        why it needs a government. Though, for the first example and the third
        example, this is hardly explicable by simple ignorance. I don't think
        one can be so ignorant as to think that powering our electrical grid
        with renewables is not an engineering challenge, or to think that
        genetically modifying the bacteria in cows to emit less methane would be
        easy. I think that some people are utopian when discussing politics and
        are dismissing engineering problems.
        <br /><br />
        <b id="libertarians_not_immune">UPDATE</b> on 08/06/2025: A question I
        sometimes ask myself is how it is that it's mostly the people on the
        left on the political spectrum who make this mistake? Hardly any
        conservative would suppose powering our national grid with renewables,
        it's the liberals who tend to say stuff like that. Hardly any
        conservative would suppose tackling the problem of superbacteria with
        lab-grown animal products, it's the liberals and libertarians who tend
        to say stuff like that. The only example of this fallacy which is
        associated with the right is supposing &quot;<i
          >encryption only government can break</i
        >&quot;: right-wingers are more likely to say that than left-wingers.
        So, why is that? Considering that engineers tend to be left-wing
        (liberal or libertarian), rather than right-wing (conservative), that is
        kind of unexpected.<br />
        I think it's partly because a moderate education about the world's
        problems can be worse than none:
        <ul>
          <li>
            People uneducated about superbacteria are mostly assuming most
            antibiotics are being used in people, so it seems obvious to them
            that the government regulation is the solution. People who are
            moderately educated about superbacteria know that 80% of antibiotics
            go to the farm animals, so it seems plausible to them that lab-grown
            animal products will soon solve that problem. It's only the people
            who are highly educated about the topic who realize that, well, most
            of the antibiotics are used in the egg industry (so much so that 45%
            of antibiotics we are using today are ionophores, antibiotics
            effective in birds but not in mammals), that we won't have lab-grown
            eggs any time soon, and that the government regulation of the egg
            industry is the only realistic solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            People uneducated about how the Internet works are usually assuming
            the government plays a huge role in it. People who are moderately
            educated about how the Internet works realize that the protocols
            used on the Internet are full of ingenious solutions as to how to
            prevent denial-of-service attacks, so it seems plausible to them
            that the Internet doesn't need a government. But people highly
            educated about how the Internet works realize that, for some
            problems, government regulation is the only realistic solution.
            Improperly set up DNS servers (which respond to requests from all IP
            addresses, rather than just the IP addresses they are supposed to
            serve, and can therefore be used to massively amplify
            denial-of-service attacks), improperly set up QUIC servers (which do
            not test whether the session has expired, or implement other
            defenses against IP spoofing attacks)... There doesn't seem to be
            any realistic technical solution to those problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            People uneducated about the problem of global warming often don't
            even believe global warming is real, or they don't see it as a big
            problem that would justify investing money in renewables. People
            moderately educated in that science can understand why most of the
            climate scientists believe global warming is real and is somewhat
            threatening, especially to the economies of poor countries. But it
            takes quite a bit of education in specific fields of engineering to
            fully understand why renewables (especially solar energy) are not a
            solution. Not everybody is educated in chemical engineering enough
            to understand why storing a lot of electricity from unreliable
            sources (such as solar and wind) is a huge engineering challenge,
            and not everybody is educated in electronical and electrical
            engineering enough to realize why converting a large amount of
            solar-generated electricity (constant current rather than constant
            voltage, direct current instead of alternating current) into a
            format we need on our national grid is an engineering nightmare.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Engineers tend to be moderately educated about the world's problems
        outside of their realm of study, rather than highly educated.
