        There is a book called &quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot; by Henry Riecken,
        Leon Festinger, and Stanley Schachter, which describes cult-like
        reasoning. While I don't think it describes <b>me</b> well, it describes
        well many of the people I met on the Internet.

        I will admit something: I recently left three different Internet groups
        which seem to frequently engage in cult-like reasoning. Those are
        anarcho-capitalists, stereotypical Internet vegans, and the people who
        believe they are scientifically studying the names of places. Some of
        the events that led to me to leave them happened in my head, most of
        them have to do with discussions on the Internet forums.

          Realization that lab-grown meat and vegetarianism do not address
          superbacteria
        </h2>
        One discussion on an Internet forum that made me question both my
        anarcho-capitalism and my stereotypical Internet veganism is this. It
        was year 2021, and I was advocating radical anarchism on an Internet
        forum. Of course, since it was the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
        conversation quickly devolved into a discussion about lockdowns and mask
        mandates. Most of the people were telling me that the government is
        necessary in order to enforce lockdowns and mask mandates during a
        pandemic, while I was citing statistics supposedly showing lockdowns and
        mask mandates do not work.<br />
        Then some very smart guy told me: &quot;<i
          >Look, I agree with you that lockdowns and mask mandates are
          relatively weak arguments for the existence of government, but not all
          public-health arguments for the existence of government are that weak.
          What do you think about superbacteria?</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        I responded: &quot;<i
          >Superbacteria are a very temporary problem. It's mostly caused by
          animal agriculture, since around 80% of antibiotics go to farm
          animals. Lab-grown animal products will soon mostly-solve that
          problem. And you can do your part even now by being a vegetarian.</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        That person told me: &quot;<i
          >But, see, lab-grown animal products will not solve that problem any
          time soon. Most of the antibiotics used in agriculture go to the egg
          industry, and we will not have lab-grown eggs any time soon. We
          sturggle to even produce muscle meat in laboratories, and eggs are far
          more complicated than muscles.</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        I did not believe him. I was under a strong impression that most of the
        antibiotics these days go to cows and pigs.<br />
        That person told me: &quot;<i
          >Well, the estimate cited on the Wikipedia article about AMR says that
          around 70% of natibiotics are used in the egg industry. And other
          estimates are not a lot lower. You need to take into account that 45%
          of antibiotics we use today are ionophores, which are antibiotics
          effective in birds, but not in mammals.</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        I admitted my mistake.<br />
        And that shaked me both out of my anarchism and out of my delusion that
        vegetarianism would solve most of the world's problems. I went on to
        discuss that fact within my cults. The responses I got there were
        absolutely pathetic. When I tried discussing superbacteria on an
        Internet forum about anarchism, I got a lot of responses that were the
        likes of: &quot;<i
          >Governments have murdered over a hundred million people in the 20th
          century, but, according to a brainwashed statist like yourself, this
          is all justified because muh superbacteria!</i
        >&quot;. Look, I think the denial that the massive use of antibiotics in
        the egg industry leads to superbacteria is even more dangerous than
        Lysenkoism (the pseudoscience that killed tens of millions of people by
        causing ecological catastrophies) because Lysenko could indeed defend
        himself with &quot;<i>I didn't know.</i>&quot;. But everybody who
        understands elementary school biology realizes that abuse of antibiotics
        has to lead to superbacteria. And on vegan forums, I got hated for
        saying that superbacteria are more important than global warming and
        that eggs are more of a threat than meat. Why? I assume that's because
        being against eggs <i>sounds</i> like you are being a right-winger that
        is also against abortion. Vegans are mostly left-wing. And hardly
        anybody is rational enough to realize that being against eggs and being
        against abortion is not remotely similar.
        <br />
        <h2 id="Internet">
          Realization that the Internet needs a government to work
        </h2>
        Back when I was an anarchist, many people were telling me the Internet
        needs a government to work. However, they were not able to present that
        argument properly. If you asked them how, they would give you some
        incomprehensible word-salad. Then, after I passed the course of Computer
        Networks on the university, I realized: &quot;<i
          >Hang on a second, what would happen if there were no laws requiring
          ISPs that, if they set up an unencrypted DNS server, they make it
          respond only to the IP addresses it is supposed to serve, rather than
          to requests from all IP addresses? Well, the answer seems obvious:
          some ISPs would set up their DNS servers improperly, and, since DNS
          servers sometimes respond to short queries with long responses (up to
          4 UDP packets to one-packet-long DNS requests), the hackers would
          paralyze the Internet by spoofing their IP addresses and making those
          long-response-causing DNS requests to the improperly configured DNS
          servers.</i
        >&quot;. That's but one of the reasons the Internet needs a government.
        I went on to discuss it on an anarchist forum, and most of the people
        there were convinced that your ISP can somehow protect you against
        denial-of-service attacks caused by DNS reflection. When I asked them
        how exactly might your ISP do that, they could not give a coherent
        response.

        <h2 id="methane">
          Realization that our methane emissions didn't decrease
        </h2>
        So, stereotypical Internet vegans believe that a switch from grain-fed
        cows to grass-fed cows is not feasible because grass-fed cows supposedly
        emit 3 times as much methane per a litre of milk, and that methane is a
        more important greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, they
        believe that our methane emissions reached their peak somewhen in the
        1980s and have been decreasing ever since, primarily because today we
        are using more grain-fed cows and less grass-fed cows. In other words,
        though they don't say that explicitly, that factory farming saved us
        from global warming.<br />
        So I went to discuss vegetarianism on an Internet forum. And, of course,
        I complained about factory farmed cows causing superbacteria.<br />
        Somebody told me: &quot;<i
          >So, why not switch to grass-fed cows? They require a lot fewer
          antibiotics.</i
        >&quot;<br />
        I responded with: &quot;<i
          >Because grass-fed cows emit 3 times as much methane per a litre of
          milk than grain-fed cows do. Methane emissions of a cow are
          approximately proportional to her cellulose intake. Grass contains
          very little starch and a lot of cellulose. And the
          feed-conversion-ratio is a lot higher for grass-fed cows than for
          grain-fed cows.</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        He told me: &quot;<i
          >Grass-fed cows emit more methane than grain-fed cows, but the
          difference cannot be three times. Cows emit methane also when
          digesting starch, just less methane than when they digest cellulose.
          And, furthermore, the methanotrophic bacteria on pastures absorb a lot
          of methane that a cow emits before it goes up into the atmosphere.</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        I responded with: &quot;<i
          >I think that's the only explanation, because you can see from this
          diagram that our methane emissions reached their peak in the 1980s
          (right when there were the most grass-fed cows around the world), and
          have been decreasing ever since. See how methane concentrations were
          growing a lot faster in the 1980s than they are growing now?</i
        >&quot;.

          "
        />
        And then he told me: &quot;<i
          >Well, to me, this diagram looks almost exactly like what we would
          expect to see if our methane emissions haven't changed since the
          1980s. Try doing a computer simulation, I think you will quickly
          understand why. All you need to know is that the half-life of the
          methane in the atmosphere is somewhere between 9 years and 12
          years.</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        I thought he was going crazy. I responded with: &quot;<i
          >What? This is an IT<sub>1</sub>-type system, do we agree? You know
          what the step response of a IT<sub>1</sub>-type system looks like? Not
          at all like the diagram I just showed you.</i
        >&quot;.
        <img

        />
        Then he told me: &quot;<i
          >No, this is not an IT<sub>1</sub>-type system. Try deriving a
          transfer function. You know what the impulse response is, right? Well,
          you can derive a transfer function from the impulse response, as a
          Laplace transform of the impulse response.</i
        >&quot;.<br />
        And, indeed, after a bit of calculating, I got that the transfer
        function is:
        <img
          src="https://flatassembler.github.io/transfer_function_of_methane.png"
          style="vertical-align: middle"
        />. That's not a transfer function of an IT<sub>1</sub>-type system, and
        the step response (printed by Octave) looks very similar to that
        diagram.
        <img

          "
        />
        I admitted my mistake.<br />
        I decided to do a more complicated computer simulation, just to be sure.
        What might our methane emissions have been? Well, if you assume the
        half-life of the methane is 12 years, you get this diagram:
        <img
          src="https://flatassembler.github.io/emisije_ako_je_poluzivot_12.png"
          style="

            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
          "
        />
        Only a slight downward trend, right?<br />
        And if you assume it is 9 years, you get this:
        <img
          src="https://flatassembler.github.io/methane_emissions_halflife_9.png"
          style="

            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
          "
        />
        No discernable trend here, right?<br />
        So I went to discuss with vegans on another Internet forum, one about
        veganism. The end result? I got banned from that forum for a year and a
        half.<br />
        Look, I still think it's important to protect the environment, and that
        eliminating animal products from our diet, <b>especially eggs</b>, is a
        way to go. But the veganism on the Internet is not at all about it. It
        has grown into a cult that discourages rational conversation. And which,
        paradoxically, gives credit to factory farming that it doesn't deserve.
        <br />
        <h2 id="toponyms">
          Realization that the study of names of places is a soft science at
          best
        </h2>
        I used to believe with a rather cult-like mentality that the study of
        the names of places is a respectable science. And, unlike those other
        cults I became a part of, this one did not come from the Internet, but
        from my father. When I had almost finished writing my book &quot;Jezici
        za gimnazijalce&quot;, my father suggested me to finish the linguistics
        part of that book with an overview of the Croatian names of places. I
        was immediately skeptical. My intuition told me that the names of places
        cannot really be studied scientifically. But I couldn't justify that
        intuition, so I gave in.<br />
        So, there seem to be two basic methodologies of studying the names of
        places competing with one another. One is Antun Mayer's methodology and
        the other is the Hans Krahe's methodology. Antun Mayer's methodology is
        based on the assumption that the etymologies from languages we know a
        lot about are somehow more probable than etymologies from languages we
        know little about. For example that, other things being equal, that the
        commonly cited etymology that the river name Kara&scaron;ica comes from
        Latin fish name <i>carassius</i> is a lot more probable than my
        etymology that Kara&scaron;ica comes from Illyrian *Kurr-urr-issia
        (flow-water-suffix), because we know a lot about Latin and very little
        about Illyrian. Hans Krake's methodology is based on the assumption that
        repetition of same or similar elements in some meaning is evidence that
        the names of places come from the same language. For example, where
        Scythians lived in antiquity, many river names start with consonants 'd'
        and 'n' (sometimes separated by a vowel): Danube, Don, Dniester, and
        Dnieper. That, according to Krahe, strongly suggests that this d-n was
        the Scythian word for &quot;to flow&quot;. Or, putting that methodology
        to the extreme (I don't know what Krahe would have thought about that),
        the fact that many river names in Croatia start with consonants 'k' and
        'r' suggests that this k-r was the Illyrian word for &quot;to
        flow&quot;: Krka, Krbavica, Kravar&scaron;&ccaron;ica, Krapina, Korana,
        and two rivers named Kara&scaron;ica. The Mayer's methodology is, for a
        reason that escapes me, a lot more mainstream.<br />
        After I passed my Information Theory course at the university, an idea
        occurred to me: &quot;<i
          >Hang on a second. The Mayers's methodology does not appear to be
          based on mathematics, but the Krahe's methodology appears to be. The
          patterns in names of places such as the k-r pattern in the Croatian
          river names have p-values, and that p-value can be calculated using
          the Collision Entropy and Birthday Paradox.</i
        >&quot;. So I did the collision entropy measurements of the Aspell
        word-list for the Croatian language, and the Monte Carlo calculations
        which take those measurements and the Birthday Paradox into account, and
        I came to the conclusion that the p-value of that k-r pattern is
        somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17. And I published a paper about it,
        called &quot;Etimologija Kara&scaron;ica&quot;, in two peer-reviewed
        (well, nominally peer-reviewed, at least) journals: Valpova&ccaron;ki
        Godi&scaron;njak and Regionalne Studije.<br />
        I went on to discuss my findings on Internet forums where the toponymy
        enthusiasts meet. And I was hated there. They were giving me all kinds
        of awkward responses. For example, two people independent of one another
        told me: &quot;<i
          >What if nouns have a significantly lower collision entropy than the
          rest of the words in the Aspell word-list? River names are nouns.</i
        >&quot;. When I asked them: &quot;<i
          >How could that even work? I can see how that might work in Swahili,
          where nouns can only start with one of 18 prefixes called noun
          classes, while verbs can start with however the phonotactics allows,
          but Croatian grammar is not remotely like that.</i
        >&quot;, they pretended (in my opinion) to be unable to understand my
        response. One person told me: &quot;<i
          >Your supposed Proto-Slavic form of the name Kara&scaron;ica,
          *K&#x044a;r&#x044a;r&#x044c;s&#x044c;ja, is impossible because
          Proto-Slavic phonotactics didn't allow four consecutive syllables with
          yers. Most likely, *Kurr-urr-issia would have been borrowed as
          *K&#x044a;ryr&#x044c;s&#x044c;ja, which would give *Krira&scaron;a in
          modern Croatian.</i
        >&quot;. When I asked him to give me some source making that
        extraordinary claim about Proto-Slavic phonotactics, they couldn't do
        that, but that didn't convince them they were wrong. Not even asking
        them to explain the phonological evolution from <i>civitate</i> to
        <i>Cavtat</i>, which appears to involve a Proto-Slavic form with four
        consecutive yers, convinced them. In fact, when I asked that question
        about <i>Cavtat</i>, I got banned from the forum.<br />
        About a year later, I made a YouTube video about the Croatian river
        names in Latin, and I went on to discuss it on another Internet forum.
        And somebody told me: &quot;<i
          >To me it seems like your computer simulations are assuming that pairs
          of consonants which are common in the middle and at the end of a word
          are also common at the beginning of a word. That's not true, and, for
          the languages such as Croatian or English, that is especially not
          true. Croatian and English allow for many consonant clusters
          word-initially and word-finally, and those consonant clusters are
          governed, to a large extent, by the Law of Sonority. The Law of
          Sonority says, among other things, that consonant clusters which are
          common word-initially are rare word-finally and vice versa. Try to
          control for that, I assume you will get a p-value significantly higher
          than 1/17.</i
        >&quot;. And, indeed, when I tried to control for that fact, I got that
        the p-value of the k-r pattern in the Croatian river names is around
        85%.<br />
        It took me 9 years of studying names of places to realize what is
        obvious to most laymen: that there is no good scientific methodology for
        studying names of places. And, indeed, there is very little scientific
        consensus among those who study Illyrian toponyms. There are only a
        handful of toponyms which all the Illyrologists agree what they meant:
        that Serapia (ancient name for Bednja) was Illyrian for &quot;flowing
        water&quot;, that Salapia (ancient name for the salt marsh Salpi in
        Apulia) was Illyrian for &quot;salty water&quot;... And those few
        toponyms that all Illyrologists agree on what they meant, they agree on
        them not because of some systematic study of the toponyms, but because
        of the harder science that is comparative Indo-European linguistics.
        Yet, the study of the toponyms was, in my mind (and in minds of quite a
        few people), highly dignified as science.
        <br />
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        I was reasoned into those beliefs, so I was able to be reasoned out of
        them. The real question is how not to get reasoned into following a
        cult. You can avoid many cults by asking yourself: &quot;<i
          >Are the arguments they are using not-even-wrong?</i
        >&quot;, and while this works against Flat-Earthism (most of the
        commonly-used arguments for Flat-Earthism, such as &quot;<i
          >The horizon appears to be rising with the observer as he climbs.</i
        >&quot;, are not-even-wrong: it's not at all obvious how the Earth being
        flat and there being magical curvings of light explains that
        phaenomenon), it doesn't really work against the cults I was until
        recently a part of (asking &quot;<i
          >How it is that our methane emissions have been decreasing over
          time?</i
        >&quot; with the implication it's because of the number of grass-fed
        cows decreasing is hardly not-even-wrong). Not even asking experts
        always works: many of my professors at the Computer Engineering
        programme, who knew far more about information theory than I did, told
        me that the arguments I presented in my paper &quot;Etimologija
        Kara&scaron;ica&quot; sound compelling to them. It's just that there is
        a technical detail in the field that connects information theory and
        linguistics that makes my calculations invalid. Maybe my mental illness
        has something to do with me not seeing how those arguments are faulty. I
        have psychosis and I need to take Risperidone, Biperiden, and
        Alprazolam.
