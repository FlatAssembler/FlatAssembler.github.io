      <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px">
        <br />It's a common misconception that USA did exceptionally poorly
        during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the Trump administration being
        hesitant to implement lockdowns and mask mandates. However, my home
        country, Croatia, had
        <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/69336">17%</a> excess
        mortality in 2020, whereas USA had only
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm">15.9%</a>.
        Both of those, however, are huge excess mortalities compared to Sweden,
        which had only
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34609261/">3%</a> excess
        mortality. Sweden had no lockdown or mask mandates, and it had very
        little social distancing. That alone should probably be enough to prove
        beyond reasonable doubt that those things have little or no effect.<br />
        Some people say it's because Croats behaved a lot more normally than
        Swedes did. To me, that seems like an obvious ad-hoc hypothesis.<br />

        I wish everybody who is proposing strategies for dealing with pandemics
        read this short essay.<br /><br />

        <b>TL;DR</b>: Richard Dawkins once said something like: &quot;<i
          >But when has theology ever said something that's of slightest use to
          anybody? When has theology said something that's demonstrably true and
          is not completely obvious? Science has found cures and vaccinations
          for all kinds of diseases, and theology in all that time has done
          nothing but talk about pestilences as a consequence of sin.</i
        >&quot;. Let's ask ourselves, do we today have a
        &quot;<i>science</i>&quot; that is talking about pestilences as a
        consequence of sin? To me it seems like we do, that it is the mainstream
        epidemiology. It is talking about the pestilence of COVID-19 as
        consequence of sin of letting our economy keep running instead of
        stopping it with lockdowns.<br /><br />

        There are, as far as I can see, three basic strategies with dealing with
        a pandemic. Those are:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
          <li>
            <b>Mainstream epidemiology.</b> That is lockdowns, mask mandates and
            social distancing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Focused protection.</b> That is an attempt to restructure the
            society so to use natural immunity of the low-risk people to protect
            the high-risk people.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>&quot;Let it rip&quot;.</b> That means, the government should
            simply do nothing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        In this short essay, I will explain as clearly as possible why I think
        the third strategy, &quot;<i>let it rip</i>&quot;, is the best.<br /><br />
        So, we are almost three years into the COVID-19 pandemic. And it is
        absurd to think this will be the last pandemic in history. Especially
        since we are massively using antibiotics in the egg industry, which
        gives birth to superbacteria, and we are doing dangerous
        gain-of-function research on viruses. Maybe there will be another
        pandemic even within my lifetime. Here are the lessons I think rulers
        should have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't pretend that masks and social distancing help
              significantly.</b
            >
            The Danish study on the masks failed to find a statistically
            significant result. The analysis of the raw data from it appears to
            suggest they provide around 18% protection. The Bengali study found
            no statistically significant result for cloth masks and the result
            for medical masks was right on the margin of error (p-value was 5%,
            which is usually considered a margin of error in science). Such
            protections are easily offset by changes in behaviour. And even from
            the epidemiological data, it is obvious masks have little or no
            effect. Places with mask mandates do not tend to have fewer COVID-19
            deaths than places without mask mandates. And people who
            participated in the Danish and Bengali studies were undoubtedly more
            conscientious about masks than most people are. Most people are
            wearing dirty masks often not covering their noses<sup
              >[citation NOT needed]</sup
            >.<br />
            If you want an intuitive explanation of why masks have little
            effect, watch one of those
            <a href="https://youtu.be/_fPfGU1MizY"
              >YouTube videos in which a pearson wears a mask outside in a cold
              weather</a
            >, so that you can clearly see how many small droplets pass through
            the mask. I think that, after that, the results of the Danish study
            or the Bengali study (and keep in mind people in those studies were
            wearing a single mask there, not two masks, and no N95 masks) should
            come as no surprise.<br />
            As for social distancing, I am not sure whether it works at all. The
            famous MIT study is often cited as a proof that it does not. Now,
            you can argue that the MIT study is methodologically very
            questionable, and I would agree with that, however... Where is the
            evidence that it does work? I think we have to admit there is no
            hard evidence that it works. And by hard evidence, I mean something
            at least as rigorous as
            <a href="Karasica.doc">my latest paper about linguistics</a>, that
            is, something with p-values and things that go with them. If you
            want to force everybody to obey some rules, you need to have hard
            evidence those rules actually work. Epidemiological data only makes
            it obvious social distancing does not have a huge effect: the places
            with strictest social distancing rules do not seem to tend to have
            fewer deaths. Maybe, just like masks, social distancing has some
            small effect (say, 18% protection) which is not visible by
            eye-balling the epidemiological data, but I see no reason to think
            that other than trusting your intuition and government propaganda
            over the empirical data.<br />
            It is intuitive to think small droplets move in such a way that you
            are essentially safe from a person emitting those droplets on the
            other side of the room. But can we say it's at least possible that
            the MIT study is telling the truth, that, in most of the situations,
            that's not the case? Like I've said, I am not saying MIT study is
            good evidence that social distancing does not work (it appears to
            contain a bit of circular reasoning), but it's at least food for
            thought for those who think their intuition about how droplets move
            is strong mechanistic evidence that social distancing works. MIT
            study is certainly better than our intuitions, and it suggests that
            social distancing might not work. We need to look at the empirical
            data to determine whether it actually works. And to me it seems that
            the only empirical data we have is the highly-noisy data from places
            with social distancing and places without social distancing. And the
            effects of social distancing are not visible by eye-balling that
            data. Now, admittedly, neither are the effects of masks or vaccines
            visible by eye-balling the data about COVID-19 cases, even though
            they demonstrably do have some effect on lowering the spread of the
            disease. Like I've said, it's entirely plausible that, just like
            masks, social distancing provides around 18% protection. Maybe even
            more, but not a lot more. If you are going to claim that social
            distancing decreases the spread by about 45%, about as much as
            vaccines do, I'd like to hear what you think those changes in
            behaviour are that eclipse those effects of social distancing from
            being visible by eye-balling the epidemiological data.<br />
            And understand that making ad-hoc hypotheses damages your
            credibility. At the beginning of the pandemic, the advocates of the
            mainstream epidemiology told us &quot;<i
              >Wear a mask to protect yourself.</i
            >&quot;. Then the Danish study proved that masks do little to
            protect those who wear them (that they provide at most around 18%
            protection, similar to what earlier studies showed masks do against
            the flu). Then the advocates of the mainstream epidemiology changed
            their rhetoric. They are now saying &quot;<i
              >Wear a mask to protect others from you.</i
            >&quot;. Now, that is a hell lot harder to test than the idea that
            masks significantly protect <b>you</b> from COVID-19, and is
            therefore an obvious ad-hoc hypothesis. We tell them that it implies
            places with masks mandates will have significantly fewer COVID-19
            deaths. And, by that time, there has come quite a bit of
            epidemiological data from both places with mask mandates and without
            mask mandates, and we showed them that just eye-balling the data
            made it obvious that's not the case. Then the advocates of
            mainstream epidemiology responded by saying &quot;<i
              >You need to adjust for other factors.</i
            >&quot;. Which is significantly harder to do, and is therefore an
            obvious ad-hoc hypothesis. Then, if you point out the fact (like I
            did in
            <a href="political_blindness.html#OtherFactors"
              >my previous blog-post</a
            >) that adjusting for simple other factors, such as life expectancy
            (as COVID-19 almost exclusively kills the elderly, so we would
            expect countries with lower life expectancy to have less excess
            mortality) or distance from the equator (as the sun kills the
            coronaviruses, so we would expect countries farther away from the
            equator, with less sun, to have higher excess mortality), does not
            quite do the trick (if anything, it makes it look even more like
            non-pharmaceutical interventions are counter-productive), they will
            demand you to adjust for complicated other factors, such as
            population density (which varies widely between parts of a country).
            Which is a lot harder to do, and is therefore an obvious ad-hoc
            hypothesis (I believe somebody on <code>mises.org</code> actually
            made a statistical analysis and found that there is no correlation
            between population density and COVID-19 cases, but I cannot find it
            now.). Quite a bit like arguing with a Flat-Earther, as
            Flat-Earthers constantly make ad-hoc hypotheses when their
            &quot;<i>theory</i>&quot; is proven wrong. Except that Flat-Earthers
            know the science is not on their side, whereas the advocates of
            mainstream epidemiology think the science is on their side. And that
            scientism makes it even harder to argue with them.<br />
            Maybe I sound like a global warming denier. But that's not remotely
            the same thing. With global warming, the best available data is sea
            temperature data, and eye-balling it makes global warming obvious.
            In fact, sea temperature data probably shows around 30% more warming
            than there really has been, due to the difference in the devices
            that used to measure sea temperature data and devices that measure
            it now. The best available data for whether non-pharmaceutical
            interventions work is excess mortality between places that had those
            and places that did not have those, and eye-balling that data does
            not make it obvious that non-pharmaceutical interventions work.
            Adjusting the continental temperature data for other factors such as
            time of observation bias does make global warming obvious even
            there. Adjusting the COVID-19 data for other factors does not make
            it any more obvious that non-pharmaceutical interventions work, in
            fact, it makes it look more like they aren't working.<br />
            I used to believe the Earth was flat. Then I used to believe the
            global warming denier Tony Heller was telling the truth. But I grew
            out of that. I learned some very hard lessons about epistemology,
            and I am not falling into similar traps again.<br />
            Mainstream epidemiology appears to be based on trusting incredibly
            simplistic computer models, with almost complete disregard for
            empirical data and the pre-COVID science. For example, most of those
            computer models are assuming everybody infected is equally likely to
            spread the disease. That's not the case: COVID-19 is spread by
            droplets, and people with symptoms emit way more droplets than
            people without symptoms. Since the vast majority of children have no
            symptoms if infected with COVID-19, the vast majority of children
            infected with COVID-19 will not spread the disease. And the main
            evidence the advocates of mainstream epidemiology have that closing
            schools is effective comes from those simplistic computer models. If
            the same computer models were applied further, it would follow that
            vaccines do not lower the spread of COVID-19. That would, of course,
            go against basics of pre-COVID epidemiology. But such simplistic
            computer models, which go against basic facts from the pre-COVID
            science, are what the mainstream epidemiology seems to be based on.

          <li>
            <b>Don't pretend immune people cannot spread the virus.</b> While
            vaccines do indeed decrease the spread of COVID-19 by around 45% (as
            <a
              href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Impact+of+vaccination+on+household+transmission+of+SARS-COV-2+in+England.pdf/35bf4bb1-6ade-d3eb-a39e-9c9b25a8122a?t=1619601878136"
              >this study</a
            >
            suggests), and provide some small protection (maybe 13%, if the
            Israeli data, from the country which massively tests both the
            vaccinated and the unvaccinated, is anything to judge by<sup
              ><a href="#FootNote1" name="PointerToFootNote1">[1]</a></sup
            >) against infection, those protections are more than offset by the
            changes in behavior. Countries with higher vaccination rate mostly
            have more COVID-19 cases, rather than less (Chile, Israel...). And
            natural immunity is almost certainly even worse than vaccine-induced
            immunity.<br />
            And this is a huge no-no, done by both people advocating mainstream
            epidemiology and people advocating focused protection. People
            advocating mainstream epidemiology often say vaccine passports
            protect immuno-compromized people for whom vaccine won't work. Well,
            if vaccines provide only around 45% protection against spreading,
            and only around 13% protection against infection, vaccine passports
            may very well be counter-productive. Sunetra Gupta, the main
            epidemiologist advocating focused protection, suggested that only
            people who survived COVID-19 should be allowed to work in nursing
            homes. Since natural immunity provides even less than 45% protection
            against spreading, and it presumably provides no protection at all
            against infection, implementing that suggestion would almost
            certainly do more harm than good.<br />
            I also think it is undeniable that vaccine passports are setting a
            dangerous precedent. Don't you think there is a lot of truth to what
            anti-vaxxers are saying &quot;<i
              >If Jews were the spreaders of typhus in the Third Reich, then the
              unvaccinated are now spreaders of COVID.</i
            >&quot;?
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't make arrogant assumptions about soft sciences.</b> It's
            absurd to say you can predict how people will behave in such extreme
            situations such as a pandemic. And understand that computer models,
            while they are very useful in hard sciences, are often worse than
            useless in soft sciences. I am saying that as a computer science
            student who has published a few papers about linguistics (the
            <a href="Karasica.doc">latest one</a> being about applying collision
            entropy and birthday paradox to calculate the p-values of some
            patterns in the names of places in Croatia). I have tried to make a
            computer model of the phonological evolution of languages (which is
            used in my <a href="etymologist.html">Etymology Game</a>), and, when
            I validated it using the real-world data, I got surprised that it
            performs little better than chance (if it even does word better than
            chance, it's possible that the control model which I took as
            &quot;<i>chance</i>&quot; actually does worse than chance). The same
            is likely true for your computer models of things in soft sciences.
            And that's in normal situations. It would then, of course, do worse
            than chance in non-normal situations.<br />
            Almost everybody thought shutting down most business will result in
            fewer people dying in car accidents. As it turns out, deaths from
            car accidents increased in 2020 compared to 2019. It is hard to
            explain how lockdowns and business closures may have worked if there
            were more traffic accidents, rather than less, right?<br />
            And I think proponents of focused protection are doing the same
            mistake. What would actually happen if we tried to implement focused
            protection? That is, if we separate families and order young people
            to try and build herd immunity (which is, in all likelihood,
            impossible for COVID-19, as immunity from COVID-19 is not remotely
            sterilizing immunity)? Something tells me it won't go well
            either.<br />
            And understand that government actions made to address the pandemic
            have the unintended consequences beyond the pandemic. Shutting down
            most business and giving people large stimuluses will lead to a huge
            inflation. Right when the economy appeared to have recovered, a huge
            inflation started. And large inflation especially hurts people like
            me, who are without a job and who live of money they got by selling
            a house.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Don't spread too much propaganda about vaccines.</b> If you ask
            any vaccine-hesitant person why they are hesitant to get vaccinated,
            the most common response you will get is something along the lines
            of &quot;<i
              ><a href="https://qr.ae/prvPkz"
                >All that propaganda is smelly to me</a
              ></i
            >&quot;. And that's understandable. Government propaganda is often
            saying that, unless everybody gets vaccinated soon, the virus will
            evolve to be vaccine-resistant. That's very far from truth, as the
            resistance to vaccines is a lot harder to evolve than, for example,
            resistance to antibiotics. Besides, how is everybody getting
            vaccinated supposed to reduce the small chance of that happening?
            Isn't saying that like saying everybody being preventatively put on
            antibiotics will decrease the chance of superbacteria evolving
            because bacteria will not be able to procreate and thus mutate as
            much? That's obviously not how biology works. And saying things like
            that kills your credibility.<br />
            Also, don't you think media propaganda is to blame for the increase
            in suicide? What else do you think causes suicide during a pandemic?
            The country with the biggest increase in suicide was Japan. Japan
            did not have a lockdown, so you cannot blame lockdowns for suicide.
            Japan was, compared to other countries, hit by the pandemic
            relatively little (so much so that it had

              >negative excess mortality in 2020</a
            >), so you cannot really blame the pandemic for suicides either. The
            only explanation I can see is the fearmongering by the media. Put it
            simply, loudly yelling &quot;<i
              >We will all be infected by a deadly vaccine-resistant virus.</i
            >&quot; kills, it causes suicide.<br />
            Also, ask yourself, how irresponsible are anti-vaxxers really,
            compared to other irresponsible things people do? Could it be that
            being against COVID-19 vaccination is only as irresponsible as being
            anti-gun? COVID-19 vaccinations are estimated to have saved around

              >300'000 lives in 2021 in the USA</a
            >. According to the famous study done by Gary Kleck in 1995, guns
            also save around 300'000 lives each year in the USA. Yet you don't
            hear nearly as much pro-gun propaganda as you hear pro-vaccine
            propaganda. You think Gary Kleck's methodology is bad? Well, explain
            to me why do you think the methodology of the study I linked to,
            estimating that vaccines saved 300'000 lives in 2021 in the US
            alone, is good? Do you even understand their methodology? I
            personally don't. Also, if you are going to claim the Gary Kleck's
            methodology is bad, isn't there a burden of proof on you to do or at
            least point to a better study? As far as I know, no other study
            tried to estimate the number of lives saved by guns in the US each
            year. If you think it's enough to complain about the flaws in
            methodology to discard a study, read up on conspiracy theorists
            (perhaps The Mad Revisionists - the conspiracy theorists who claim
            the Moon doesn't exist) and consider the matters again. You cannot
            manufacture the truth by discarding the evidence. That's not how
            science works. Gary Kleck's study is, until you point to a better
            study, the best data we have. And I see no reason to think that
            almost everybody who thinks a gun saved their life is somehow
            mistaken, which seems to be the only way Gary Kleck's study could be
            wildly wrong.

            <b>Preserve the rule of law.</b> That means, don't pass blatantly
            unconstitutional eviction moratoriums, and let the same laws that
            apply to everybody else apply to the pharmaceutical companies
            producing vaccines. Otherwise, you are setting a very dangerous
            precedent. Unless, of course, that is what you want. Maybe you want
            people to believe rule of law is worse than useless.<br />
            Also keep in mind that the Constitution was written during a severe
            smallpox pandemic. Since the Founding Fathers thought that laws such
            as eviction moratoriums were not a good idea back then (that's why
            they made them unconstitutional), they would also think that now,
            when the epidemiological situation is a lot better. And, yes, they
            understood how smallpox spread. They inoculated the entire army with
            smallpox with a precursor of vaccine that had around 3% mortality
            rate, so that the soldiers won't catch smallpox during a battle,
            which would kill around 20% of them. It is undeniable the Founding
            Fathers thought eviction moratoriums were a bad idea. It is slightly
            harder to tell what they would think about lockdowns or forced
            vaccination for everybody (you could argue they didn't force
            everybody to get vaccinated with a &quot;<i>vaccine</i>&quot; that
            kills 3% of the people only because it had 3% mortality rate), but I
            think they would also think those were a bad thing as well.
          </li>
        </ol>
        I hope that now the &quot;<i>let it rip</i>&quot; strategy of dealing
        with pandemics seems a lot more reasonable now than it seemed before
        reading this. I understand that you feel the need to do something rather
        than nothing. But you need to understand that the same tendency made
        medieval physicians do things such as bloodletting, which were worse
        than useless.<br />
        The COVID-19 pandemic probably started on a wet market, and there is
        little government could do to prevent it. Although it may have been
        contained if only the Chinese government did not try to censor the early
        reports about it. But there are things governments can do to prevent
        future pandemics. Governments could stop funding the dangerous
        gain-of-function research. And they could also stop massively
        subsidizing the egg industry, which, the way it's done today, gives
        birth to superbacteria. Unless they do those things, I am afraid they
        have no right to say they care about public health.

        <sup><a name="FootNote1" href="#PointerToFootNote1">[1]</a></sup> It is
        hard to tell whether that 13% is an underestimate or an overestimate.
        Maybe vaccines provide less than 13% protection against infection, and
        unvaccinated, being less health-conscientious, are slightly more likely
        to attend indoor celebrations than vaccinated people are. Maybe vaccines
        provide significantly more than 13% protection against infection, but
        vaccinated are behaving as if they cannot spread the virus and are
        massively attending indoor celebrations. I see no way to tell what's
        going on in Israel.
