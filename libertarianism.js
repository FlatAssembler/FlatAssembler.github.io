      "The first step towards understanding it is perhaps the realization that government isn't actively trying to protect us. This might seem absurd at first, but think of it this way. The police almost always only comes after a psychopath has already murdered someone. And then almost always they put him in a place not where he will rehabilitate, but to a place (prison or jail) from which he will return with even more psychological problems, that made him murder in the first place. For all we know, they could just be making things worse. In fact, the history appears to support the notion that the government attempting to prevent crime actually causes it. In the middle ages, the knights were bossing everyone around, yet you couldn't safely walk the streets because of the criminals. It has been noted since ancient times, by Lao Zi, that \"The more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers.\". Also, the US has the highest incarceration rate of all the countries in the world today (except possibly North Korea), almost 3% of its population is behind bars, yet it also has the most mass shootings per capita. If policing prevented crime, we would expect to see countries with higher incarceration rate and with more police shootings to be lower in crime, right? Yet, we do not see that, in fact, we see the opposite of that. It seems that the effect of policing that it provokes crime is greater than the effect of it deterring crime, or, at least, that factors other than policing play a much greater effect on crime and that the effect of policing on crime is negligible "

    '<span id="details" style="display:none">A common counter-argument (I think it was brought up by Thomas Hobbes, as <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>, and that Confucius also expressed a similar idea) is that there is evidence of at least some tribal societies being violent way before the rulers in today\'s sense existed, and that that\'s evidence that giving people too much freedom would lead to violence. But there aren\'t many reasons to think that would actually happen. First, people back then had religions that commanded them to murder the infidels (<i>id est</i>, the people of other tribes) or do human sacrifices. Today, we don\'t have that. If we did, the government wouldn\'t be able to stop that violence. It isn\'t able to stop even the Islamic terrorists, yet alone transform the entire society of religious lunatics into reasonable and peaceful people. Second, today we have capitalism. If you have at least some money, it\'s usually much cheaper to buy something you need than to kill for that. It also usually makes it much cheaper to hire someone to work for you than to have slaves. In fact, we can only speculate on what is the cause of war being more common before civilization, because we do not even know if that phenomenon is real. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marija_Gimbutas">Marija Gimbutas</a>, one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century, famously argued <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-06-11-tm-2975-story.html">world was at peace</a> before patriarchy came along with agriculture. It is not easy to tell what most social scientists think today. In any case, I see no reason to think government is a true or even a coherent explanation, assuming that phenomenon is real.<br/>' +
    "And I think people making such arguments shows the failure (or success, if the real purpose of our education system is actually indoctrination) of our education system. It is easy to make people fight a hypothetical-at-best danger that is tribal warfare with governments if they do not see the real danger that are genocidal or vastly incompetent but intrusive governments. People saying stuff like that are probably thinking &quot;<i>Well, it is better to risk having a Holocaust once in a century than to risk having tribal warfare every day.</i>&quot;, not realizing Holocaust was not the only major government-made tragedy of the 20th century, or even the biggest one. And people say stuff like that not only about politics. People, who are arguing factory farming is necessary, often say that, without factory farming, meat would not be available to most of the people, and that, without meat, lysine deficiency leading to poor immune system would be common. There are many problems with that argument (meat is not the only or even remotely the cheapest source of lysine, in fact, almost every plant other than wheat contains some lysine), the biggest one being that factory farming inevitably leads to superbacteria. So, what is more important to fight, a nearly-certain pandemic of superbacteria plus an obvious animal-rights-crisis or a hypothetical-at-best pandemic of lysine deficiency? And people somehow feel that people arguing against intrusive governments or against factory farming carry the burden of proof. Thanks to our education system, they perceive government and factory farming as sources of safety, rather than the sources of threat which they are. They think merely pointing out to the problem of tribal warfare (presumably equivalent to the problem of religious terrorism) somehow justifies the existence of governments, or that merely pointing out to the problem that, for many poor people around the world, wheat is the primary source of protein, and that they suffer from lysine deficiency leading to poor immune system because of that, somehow justifies factory farming. It does not, as long as you do not show both that the supposed cures actually address the problem and are not worse than the disease. Especially if there appear to be some steps we can take that seem far less dangerous, such as, in case of lysine deficiency, simply try informing people about lysine deficiency and where lysine is found (which I bet most people suffering from lysine deficiency do not know). Unfortunately, there does not seem to be such a simple solution against religious terrorism, but that does not automatically make governments a viable solution.<br/>" +
    "Another common objection is that it is supposedly guns that make the USA so unsafe. But the problem with that objection is it doesn't seem to be a rule that guns make a country less safe. If that were true, Switzerland and Serbia would be about as unsafe as the USA is, as they also have a lot of guns per capita. Furthermore, how do you know guns don't make us more safe, rather than less safe? Look up the Gary Kleck's 1995 study.<br/>" +

      'In case there is any ambiguity, I am not saying I believe policemen are evil. Any more than you think (I hope) monks and preachers of religions you do not believe in are somehow evil. I think that policemen honestly believe they are helping the society. They probably think they are preventing recidivism and giving people a true sense of justice. But, like I think I have shown, recidivism is not something to worry about when it comes to murder and, even if it were, prisons would not be a solution (although death penalty might be). Also, how is it justice if there is basically 50/50 chance of getting away with murder? Justice is if willful actions have predictable consequences. Also, to quote Ayn Rand, we are living in a society where nobody knows first-hand what is legal and what is not. We have so many laws and they are so complicated that nobody can fully understand them. For laws to be just, an average person needs to be able to understand them. It is indisputable fact that, at least for some parts of the law, that is impossible. Some legal cases involving the tax on companies in the USA ended up in favor of companies not because they did not break the law, but because the court ruled it was beyond reasonable doubt impossible for the owners of those companies to know about that obscure tax and how to pay it. I think that is not only justice, but that it should be applied much further. Not to mention there is also a huge gap between what people think the law says and what it actually says. Copyright laws being the most obvious example. Most people think that, if there is no copyright licence on something, that means it is not copyrighted. In reality, a piece of software without a licence is implicitly "all rights reserved". So, how is it justice to punish somebody for having a common misconception about the law? People similarly tend to have misconceptions about what "free speech" means. Presumably most people think it means Twitter and similar services cannot ban you just for expressing a controversial opinion. In reality, they can, and courts protect them in that case. The term "free speech" does not refer to private companies at all, it is supposed to protect you from getting into jail just for expressing a controversial opinion. Except that, in reality, it does not even do that, it is basically a meaningless phrase. In September 2019, the Croatian journalist Gordan Duha\u010dek got into jail for complaining about the police brutality on Twitter, based on a law against apocalyptic preachers damaging public moral feelings by saying everybody is going to hell (but, apparently, anti-abortion activists saying exactly that do not end up in jail), and that law dates back from communism and predates Croatian constitution. To a layman, that sounds like a frivolous lawsuit, but, apparently, it is not. The Croatian singer Marko Perkovi\u0107 Thompson also got into legal trouble just because of the things he said about politics, and he barely escaped jail by paying a lot of money to lawyers. And, no, appealing to the constitution is not what saved him. The lawsuit was incredibly complicated, but it did not involve the constitution. Such things are incredibly rare, but the fact that they happen at all is problematic. Similarly, to a layman, government forcing everybody to participate in a poorly-designed experiment to see if lockdowns slow down the pandemic seems blatantly unconstitutional, as lockdowns restrict the freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, and are laws in favor of religions because churches were excempt from lockdowns (in spite of science being remarkably clear that churches, where elderly people gather, are far more dangerous than, for example, schools). Apparently, due to some legal mumbo-jumbo, unproven public health interventions can legally be enforced, no matter what the constitution says. In many countries (thankfully not in Croatia), many people got into jail simply for questioning the scientific validity of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns on social media, and many of those countries previously had a better track record of protecting free speech than Croatia had. So, how is enforcing this impossible-to-fully-understand system of essentially-arbitrary rules that are laws, under which you can end up in jail merely because you said something controversial, justice? It is not justice, and police officers are priests of a false religion most people are believers in. Or, maybe better say, they are Don Quixotes accepted by the society, doing things dangerous to themselves thinking they are helping the society, but ending up either making no difference or harming the society. I cannot understand people, like the American politicians Theodore Eisenberg and Geoffrey Parsons Miller, who are explicitly saying that it is more important that a law exists than that it is just. Go tell that to people like Gordan Duha\u010dek, who ended up in prison for disobeying an unjust law! Or, better yet, tell that to the families of COVID-19 patients who died because of the laws forbidding third-party repairs of medical devices to supposedly protect manufacturers of those medical devices... during a pandemic, no less! I doubt such a law would ever get passed in a dictatorship where the rule of law is not valued, I think such absurd laws can only be passed by the congress full of politicians who are mostly not even reading the laws they are signing, much less thinking about them.'

In other words, it is possible for a police officer who injures a shooter to prevent a certain mass shooting to get in jail because of that. The question is, of course, whether the presence of the police decreases the chance of a mass shooting occurring. Admittedly, I do not have hard data about that, but I expect the answer to be no. First of all, the corollary of that is civilians having weapons would also decrease the incidence of mass shootings, presumably even more so. Such a claim is considered insane by most Croatians. The public in the USA is obviously divided about that issue, but social scientists do not seem to be. The positions social scientists take seem to range between gun control (restricting civilian access to firearms) having no effect (that is the view I subscribe to, as it seems like a reasonable null-hypothesis when there is no good data, and, furthermore, most gun control laws are banning automated weapons, those that may actually come useful for self-defense when every second counts, while leaving weapons that are actually used in mass shootings legal) on mass shootings to it having a significant positive effect, significantly decreasing the incidence of mass shootings. It is hard to imagine how police might have a significant effect on stopping mass shootings, if there is no evidence armed civilians can stop mass shootings. Second, the corollary of that seems to be that countries which are more policed have fewer mass shootings. And that seems obviously false. In the USA, for example, around "

Clearly, in at least some cases, the police kills, rather than saves. Those are isolated incidents, but, as I believe I have shown, police preventing a crime is also an isolated incident. In order to justify having a police force, because the police force is costly, you would need to show with hard data that it saves significantly more people than it kills.

      'And about death penalty, well, like I have said, it makes more sense than prisons, because prisons are places from which criminals return to society presumably more dangerous than they were when they entered it. Putting people who do petty crimes into prisons accomplishes the unwanted "learn from the best" effect, I do not think it is deniable. And murderers are, when in prison, almost always abused there, which leaves bad psychological consequences. Those bad psychological consequences, if anything, make murderers even more dangerous once they return from prison. It is hard to deny prisons make us less safe. Death penalty, unlike prisons, actually removes dangerous people from the society. However, I think putting our faith in it commits the same logical fallacy as when people think antivirus programs make us significantly safer. Any real algorithm for detecting computer viruses will have some false-positives, that is, detecting innocent programs as viruses (or other type of malware). This is even more true now than in the past, because now many programs (Internet browsers...) include just-in-time compilers. Just-in-time compilers are an optimization of interpreters (necessary for executing JavaScript, the standard programming language of the Internet), which produces machine code directly understandable by CPU and executes it, which is faster than traditional interpreters. However, it is difficult to differentiate programs that do that from computer viruses, because computer viruses are malicious programs, usually directly understandable by CPU, which make copies of themselves. False positives of antivirus programs can have just as devastating consequences as malware. A few times, it has happened that system files from Windows Update get incorrectly recognized as malware, making countless computers useless. In May 2007, that was done by Symantec antivirus. In April 2010, this happened to McAfee, at the time of Windows XP SP3. In December 2010, it happened to AVG antivirus, when it detected system files of 64-bit Windows 7 as malware. As well, many security updates to SpiderMonkey, the JavaScript engine of the Firefox web browser, have been incorrectly flagged as viruses by antivirus software, making Firefox use outdated and less secure versions.

      '. Antivirus programs may even end up harming the development of innocent programs more than it harms the development of malware, because malware developers tend to have a good idea of how antivirus programs work and have good intuitions what might trigger them, whereas developers of innocent programs tend not to know the details of how algorithms for detecting various types of malware work and can (just like I did when making the compiler for my programming language) unintentionally trigger them. People who trust antivirus programs massively underestimate the damage done by false positives and massively overestimate the protection they provide. Maybe it is because of what they were taught in school about computers, which is massively influenced by big corporations. Perhaps it is because of human psychology, as we tend to think bad things happen intentionally (that if a computer is malfunctioning, it is likely due to hacker attack), rather than being unintended consequences (that a computer is malfunctioning because of faulty antivirus software). For the same reason, death penalty can easily end up killing more people than it saves, even though that idea might sound crazy to its proponents. Of 100 murderers, only 1 or 2 are serial killers who will murder again. How do you reliably detect them? Because, if you kill a murderer who will not murder again, you have killed one person and saved nobody. Furthermore, any real justice system with death penalty will put at least some innocent people on death row. A widely cited statistic is that at least 4% of people on death row in the US are actually innocent. To put in another way, it is possible death penalty is killing more innocent people than it saves, not just people in general. I understand that, like the famous vegan activist Gary Yourofsky said multiple times, abolishing death penalty is an example of how flawed the idea of human rights is, because death penalty is certainly more humane than leaving people in prison for the rest of their lives. However, we cannot use one big government policy to justify the another. Prisons are a big government policy, they cannot be used to justify another big government policy that is death penalty. To summarize, while I think the idea of death penalty makes significantly more snese than the idea of prisons, nevertheless, I think it is based on fallacies of people drastically overestimating recidivism of murder and trusting the justice system way more than it can actually be trusted. I also like the quote by Ludwig von Mises that, as long as the constitution does not outlaw death penalty altogether, every single law and every single contract implicitly end with "...or else you might be put on the death row.". When I first heard that quote, back when I began studying politics, that quote seemed absurd to me. Now, when I realize just how absurd the justice system is, that quote seems like an uncomfortable but undeniable truth.'

      "Of course, one of the most common arguments for both prisons and death penalty is that, supposedly, if those are in place, many mentally ill people who would otherwise murder will not do that out of fear. In my opinion, this just illustrates how dangerous it can be that people feel like they understand social sciences, when, in fact, they just have a bunch of hard-to-correct misconceptions about how human mind works. That claim, although it is dangerously instinctual to think that way, is not supported by evidence. Countries with higher incarceration rate do not have less crime, in fact, the opposite seems to be true. Countries with death penalty, well, there does not seem to be any correlation. Two major countries with death penalty today are China and the US. China has relatively little crime (although still slightly more than Croatia, where the constitution explicitly bans death penalty), whereas US has, according to some statistics, higher murder rate than Somalia (which is, in minds of the many, a synonym for a high-crime country). People, like I have said, seem to think they are able to predict how people who have lost their mind will behave. If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, this is not the case. Let's be honest, you did expect suicide levels to rise the most in middle-aged people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic? But that is not what happened, suicide rates rose the most in teenagers and in the military. You expected countries with higher COVID-19 mortality and with more lockdowns to be the most plagued with suicide, right? Yet, the country in which suicide rate spiked the most in 2020 was Japan, which neither had significant COVID-19 mortality (more people dying of suicide there than of COVID-19) nor many public health interventions. You also did not expect deaths from traffic accidents to be higher in 2020 in the US than in 2019 in the US, in spite of all the laws supposed to limit movement (which people, as it turns out, are not actually obeying), right? From far-left to the far-right, almost everybody believed shutting down all non-essential business will make a 21st-century-man stay at home, they just disagreed on whether it was worth the economic damages. Yet, the data about traffic accidents and mobile phone data in 2020 brings into question (if not outright disproves) that very basic premise of lockdowns. I think we all had pre-conceived notions about social sciences, particularly about mental health, which the data from this pandemic disproved. When we are trying to solve a mental health issue that is crime using politics, we are, quite literally, like Michael Huemer said, in the position of ancient physicians. We are trying to solve the problems we do not understand with cures we cannot understand how they work, and we will probably end up being counter-productive, and at best we will end up merely alleviating the symptoms. What amazes me the most is that lack of humility by people insinsting policies such as prisons and death penalty help. How can they be so confident when speaking about such soft-science issues with incredibly noisy data? Why aren't people so confident when talking about something like physics, where you are far more likely to get things right by reasoning without looking at the data, than you are likely to get things right that way in social sciences? Government actions, if they should exist at all, should be very humble and there should be a lot of focus of doing no harm. The policies of prisons from which people arguably return with even more psychological problems, and therefore more dangerous, than when they entered them, and in which many innocent people end up, and death penalty which will inevitably kill some innocent people, those policies are far from humble and first-do-no-harm. Besides, how does it make any sense to suppose serial killers value their own life enough to be deterred by death penalty? What also amazes me is the near-anonymous agreement between people of various political affiliations on such a nonsensical and obviously destructive policy that are prisons. Why isn't the claim that prisons should exist nearly as controversial as death penalty or gun control, given that both death penalty and gun control make by orders of magnitude more sense than prisons do? Of course, they do not make a lot of sense either, but the opposition to prisons seems to be so disproportionately low given how little sense prisons make. Many people complain that racial minorities such as African-Americans (in the USA) or national minorities such as Gypsies (in Croatia) are disproportionately present in prisons. Many people also complain about the abuse of prisoners, such as rape (in the USA) or "

The death of George Floyd, a person killed by a police officer called Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis in front of cameras on May 25 in the year 2020, was not followed by remarks about how police may be doing more harm than good, but by remarks about how we need to fight racism, even though there was no evidence Derek Chauvin was motivated by racism or that he even wanted to kill George Floyd (Derek Chauvin was holding his knee on the neck of George Floyd, which probably would not have killed George Floyd if he didn't have COVID-19 and was not on a lethal dose of heroin, which Derek Chauvin had no way of knowing). What is going on here? Why is it so controversial to question whether police or prisons are necessary? I suppose it has to do with what Noam Chomsky said that the most effective way of brainwashing people is to encourage a very lively debate within a narrow set of options. There is a vivid debate between left-wingers and right-wingers, but they both agree on what are, according to me, absurd or at least very dubious things. Both agree we should be paying Don Quixotes that are the police officers using the tax money, both agree at least some mentally ill people should be put to prisons where they will inevitably be abused just so that other mentally ill people might be deterred from crime, and so on."

      'I think one of the best arguments against believing government policies help is, similar to what the vegan and anarchist philosopher Michael Huemer said, that they do not appear to change as social sciences advance. Medicine, which is following the science, changes a lot over time. Almost no medical treatment which was used in ancient times is still used today, because the science has shown ancient guesses about what will help ill people (bloodletting...) to be wildly wrong. Many treatments from even 100 years ago have been rejected because the science has advanced. If you had diabetes 100 years ago, your doctor would have recommended you a high-fat diet. Today, almost no doctor would recommend you that, because the nutritional science has shown that to be counter-productive. If you had kidney problems 100 years ago, your doctor would have recommended you a low-protein diet. Today, almost no doctor would recommend you that, because science has shown our early guesses about what causes kidney disease (protein causing calcium to leave our bones and go to kidneys) to be wrong and that a low-protein diet has no effect. Yet, even though social sciences have also advanced considerably in the last 100 years, the treatments for societal problems used in politics mostly date back to ancient times. The idea about the rule of law, for example, arguably dates back to Aristotle, if not the phrase. Politics has almost not changed at all in the last 100 years. If a murder happened 100 years ago, the police and the courts would have basically done the same thing as they do today. Passports and immigration restrictions have existed ever since World War 1. When an economic recession happens, politicians react about the same as they reacted 100 years ago. Both George W. Bush and Herbert Hoover, when trying to solve an economic depression, tried trickle-down economics (giving money to big corporations in hope they will create new high-paying jobs for many people), in spite of the consensus among economists being that is counter-productive (If economic signals are distorted to make it look like the best thing for corporations to do is to employ nobody new, giving them more money, if anything, makes things worse.). Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Barack Obama both tried massive job programs, even though the consensus among economists seems to be that they have little or no effect (Consider what Mises said: "I see no reason to think massive job programs during economic depressions help the economy. But I am quite sure they are a bad public health policy. They are literally spreading the infectious diseases among the malnourished. For that reason alone, I think they should not be tried.". That was, of course, more true during the Great Depression than today, but it also holds some truth today. Consider also what Milton Friedman said: "I see no way massive job programs could work to get the economy out of depression. Massive job programs means less money spent carefully (because of the taxes), and more money spent carelessly. In my opinion, counting government spending into the total spending of a society is a complete misunderstanding of economic models.".). Similarly with the pandemics, ever since the middle ages, the governments respond to pandemics by recommending people to wear masks and by shutting down all businesses considered non-essential. But there was never good evidence such policies slowed the pandemics down, much less that they are cost-effective. Sometimes governments, such as the Reagan administration during the HIV pandemic, were recommending mask wearing with no evidence the pandemic was spread by droplets in the first place. That public health recommendation was obviously not based on science (whether or not the same is true for COVID-19 and masks is complicated). Clearly, the reason we have some policy has much more to do with tradition than with evidence that policy is effective. I see two possibilities here:'

      "And I think it should be obvious what is more probable. But people are applying special pleading to politics, as if the evidence necessary to show some policy was good was different from and much lower than the evidence necessary to show some medical treatment was good. If I suggested we should judge a medical treatment by hiring a bunch of hermeneuticists to tell us whether Benjamin Rush (the doctor who tried to cure George Washington of epiglottitis by bloodletting) would think it was good, you would consider me crazy. But when somebody suggests we should judge whether Obamacare (the law that says that everybody who makes a certain amount of money must pay into the funds of medical insurance companies) or eviction moratorium (the law that says that, during a pandemic, landlords must not expell people from the houses landlords themselves own) are good by hiring a bunch of jurists who work at the Supreme Court of the US to tell us what the people who signed the US Constitution would have thought about those laws, then it is somehow reasonable. It should be obvious that both suggestions are equally absurd. What people who knew about social sciences less than a 5th-grader today does would have thought about some law should have no bearing on whether the law in question is a good law, any more than what ancient physicians would have thought about some treatment has any bearing on whether it is good. And talking about what the Founding Fathers would have thought about Obamacare or eviction moratoriums deeply poisons the discussion about whether such laws are good. Similarly, almost nobody takes 100-year-olds insisting smoking is healthy seriously, because people understand that is very weak evidence, and that 100-year-olds are simply the lucky ones, and not somebody who knows the secrets of healthy life. Yet, many people think Walmart and Amazon have something meaningful to say about economics, and that they should be listened to when they are suggesting dubious-at-best policies such as the minimum wage. It should be obvious both 100-year-olds insisting smoking is healthy and big corporations insisting mainstream economics is wrong about policies such as the minimum wage are in the same position: having some personal anecdote that they think provides them with a special insight into the issue, when in fact they are less competent than an average person (if Amazon and Walmart are even saying that in good faith, if they are not trying to use the government to get rid of the competition). Another example of people applying special pleading to politics is that, when somebody says he will join a street fight for what he guesses are the good guys, people consider him insane. Yet, when the president of the United States wages a war so that the United States acts as a police officer of international relations, that is considered relatively normal. It should be obvious both are insane ideas. Yet another example: nobody would send an army onto a factory because they think that factory has bad working conditions, but what when that army is the police? Another example: you would be considered a dangerous idiot if you suggested somebody to take a drug that has supposedly helped you when you had similar symptoms unless they have actually been diagnozed to have the same disease (high blood pressure has similar symptoms as low blood pressure, so a drug that helped you when you had high blood pressure will be deadly to somebody with low blood pressure, but you may very well have the same symptoms). However, when somebody suggests policies similar to Roosevelt's New Deal would probably help us today just because they supposedly helped back in the day, that is considered normal political reasoning. It should be obvious both suggestions are absurd. The causes of the Great Depression, which Roosevelt was trying to solve, were, in all likelihood, very different than the causes of (far less severe, actually) economic recessions we have today: Great Depression was at least partly caused by massive deflation of the US dollar, around a third of all US dollars were exported to foreign lands in a relatively short time period with nothing within the US replacing them (The US government had basically nationalized the banking industry back in 1913 and, before the Great Depression, it refused to print more dollars, even as more gold was mined or imported, in a false belief prices would continue falling faster than wages forever. Another example of a government being a medieval physician, one can say. As well as government breaking its own law that is the gold standard, the law that said the number of US dollars should be tied to the amount of gold there is in the US.), but there is nothing like that happening today (the vast majority of currencies today having a slight inflation, rather than extreme deflation). Proposing sound money such as some form of cryptocurrency (maybe even gold, although gold would probably just make the problems less severe, rather than solving them) could prevent both the Great Depression and modern economic recessions is somewhat plausible, but suggesting the same government policy could somehow cure both really is not. For some reason, proposing the same cure for diseases with vastly different causes is considered fine in politics, even though it would be considered ridiculous elsewhere. And I am sure you can think of many other examples where people apply special pleading to political issues. In real social sciences, such as linguistics, a claim made too long ago is automatically considered to probably be false, even if it sounds reasonable (like the claim by Constantine Porphyrogenitus that the name Spalatum, the ancient name for the city of Split, comes from Greek for spiny broom flower, \u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, that claim is rejected primarily because other claims about names of places made by Constantine Porphyrogenitus are obviously false). By contrast, in politics, being traditional is considered to be somehow a good thing."

There are volunteers who want to fix holes in the roads, but now they cannot because the government is getting in the way. Furthermore, in a libertarian society, factories would probably want to have roads close to them so workers can drive to them (like Google is maintaining an open-source browser so people can actually see the adverts they are hosting).

      '. One of the best quotes I heard about that is the quote by Michael Huemer that politicians today are in the position of the medieval physicians. Medieval physicians had pre-scientific ideas about how human bodies work and their treatments were usually worse than useless. Today, politicians have pre-scientific ideas about how the society works, and the best thing for them to do is to do nothing, no matter how disappointing that is. All until the 19th century, physicians thought bloodletting was a cure for many diseases. This even included anaemia. So, most of the time, it was worse than useless. How did the physicians convince themselves that bloodletting was useful? First of all, the "science" back then taught that most illnesses were caused by disbalance of bodily fluids, so it was instinctual to think bloodletting could help for many illnesses. Also, obviously, if the symptoms are caused by high blood pressure, bloodletting would appear to help. So, at the best of times, it relieved the symptoms, while making the underlying illness even worse (by stifling the distribution of oxygen by blood). Until the beginning of the 20th century, physicians thought a ketogenic (a low-carbohydrate low-protein diet) could cure type-2-diabetes. There is little doubt it made things worse, as low-carbohydrate diets lead to kidney problems in humans (and, contrary to popular belief, protein has little or no impact on that), and people with type-2-diabetes are even more vulnerable to that. As well, any real ketogenic diet is high in saturated fat which make type-2-diabetes worse and can even cause it in large amounts. But type-2-diabetes is often made worse by food allergies, which a severely restrictive diet coincidentally avoids (a low-protein diet, for example, does not contain milk or soy, the biggest sources of food allergies). As well, it is instinctual to think removing glucose and stuff that is easily converted to glucose (most amino-acids in protein) would help lower the glucose in blood. This was enough to convince the pre-scientific physicians that it helps. And the same is probably true for the modern-day government policies. Artificially lowering the interest rates seems like an excellent example of that. Low interest rates mean that it is less expensive to borrow money from banks, for some projects that may return that money back. But are high interest rates actually the problem? Or are they a signal something is wrong with the economy and that one should not start ambitious projects, as ambitious projects are likely to fail in the current economic situation? Quite a few economists think lowering interest rates, while they postpone economic depressions, they also make depressions worse. And the same goes for agricultural subsidies, but more on that later. A good example as to how modern politicians (as well as voters and activists) are like medieval physicians is when Donald Trump said that, after having studied healthcare once he became the president and tried to fix it, he became amazed at how complicated the problem is. Luckily, he became aware of the complexity of the problem he was trying to solve before trying to implement his proposed (almost certainly counter-productive) solutions. Many, if not most politicians, never come to that realization. The Russian president Vladimir Putin said about the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg: "I agree it is important to care about the environment. But I do not think she understands the complexity of the issue. I think she does not understand how easily policies intended to protect the environment can backfire, and how easily they can end up horribly hurting people in countries much poorer than Sweden, that is her home country. I do not think she even has the perspective about what is happening in poorer countries.". But that is, in my opinion, true for almost every politician and almost every activist. Greta Thunberg, because she started researching the topic so young, at least has more time to realize that.'

      'A common counter-argument, noted even by Michael Huemer himself, to that argument is that, given that we have at least some understanding of social sciences today, the government policies which try to base themselves on social sciences are at least slightly more likely to alleviate the symptoms than to make things worse. As appealing as this idea sounds, I think it is false. To understand why, consider the history of nutritional science. In the 1920s and 1930s, we understood that cholesterol leads to heart disease... but we thought cholesterol in our blood was the cholesterol we eat. The myth that the cholesterol in our blood is the cholesterol we eat is based on "common sense", as well as on the 1913 experiment on rabbits by Nikolay Anichkov which supposedly suggested that, but which nobody managed to replicate. As such, a common dietary advice was to replace eggs with butter. Today, we know this is a very wrong advice, as cholesterol in eggs we eat has little impact on the cholesterol in our blood, but saturated fat in butter have huge impact on it, as well as butter containing trans-saturated fat, which eggs do not. Now, you might say that replacing eggs with butter was not really following the science, as there were no studies suggesting exactly that replacing eggs with butter was good (studies to test that were hard to do back then, when measuring cholesterol was very expensive). Which is a good point, but it just illustrates how following even hard science (such as nutritional science) is hard. There have been studies strongly suggesting saturated fat leads to heart disease ever since the late 19th century, but it is easier to reason about a simplistic hypothesis (such as that the cholesterol in our blood is mostly the cholesterol we eat) than to immerse yourself in messy real-world data and make conclusions based on that real-world data. To doctors in 1920s, the claim that saturated fat, rather than the cholesterol one eats, causes heart disease, that claim probably seemed like magical thinking. Then, in the 1950s, when it became clear the vast majority of cholesterol in our blood is produced by our liver, mostly in response to saturated fat in the diet, a common advice was to replace butter with margarine. As we now know, following that advice played little or no effect. What causes heart disease in butter is primarily the trans-saturated fat in it, rather than saturated fat in it (though, of course, they play some role). Trans-fat get absorbed in our blood and cause our immune system to misbehave and cause heart attacks. Margarine also contains trans-fat. The answer to the question whether margarine is better than butter is, as we now know, "It depends on which butter and which margarine.". Again, you might say there was never good evidence suggesting that replacing butter with margarine works, and it is obviously true. However, the history of nutritional science clearly illustrates just how easy it is to make yourself worse off by trying to follow the science. To be more likely to help than to hurt, you need to know a lot about the relevant science, and not just little. There are countless examples of how somebody might convince themselves they are following the science, while they are doing exactly the opposite of what the science suggests. It is, for example, a well-known thing that methionine is necessary for synthesis of literally all protein, because ribosomes cannot synthesize a protein the first amino-acid of which is not methionine (since the start codone on mRNA is also the codone for methonine). It is tempting to conclude that the form of protein found in sesame seeds, which is high in methionine, is therefore healthy. That is, it is tempting to conclude that until you know there is overwhelming evidence that the form of protein found in sesame seeds causes heart disease in humans. And if it is so easy to be misled by trying to follow nutritional science, how easy it must be to get misled by trying to follow social sciences, which are far more messy than nutritional science? And it is not just nutritional science, it is also even harder sciences. If somebody who knows only a little about how Internet works tries to diagnoze connectivity problems, they will probably try to do that using PING and/or TRACEROUTE. Quite often, this will lead to misdiagnozing the problem, because many networks these days reject all ICMP messages (that PING and TRACEROUTE use), and for a good reason (receiving a malformed ICMP massage will cause a poorly-configure server to crash, which is called "PING of Death"). But I would wager that most people who know how to use TRACEROUTE do not understand that it is often unreliable and why. And softer the science becomes, less useful "knowing a bit about it" becomes.'

      'I understand that, sometimes, extremely simple and even apparently-mysterious cures can alleviate the symptoms, while very rarely making things worse. If a computer won\'t connect to the Internet right after being turned on, most laymen would respond by restarting that computer. From experience we know that, quite often, that would work. Now, if you reason about it with the basic knowledge of computers, it seems absurd: should not we expect exactly the same thing to happen if we change no settings and we just restart the computer? My computer science professor told me, when I asked him, that it probably has to do with network card drivers incorrectly implementing the DHCP protocol (protocol through which computers come to know their IP address), that is, that they correctly handle DHCP transactions if everything goes right, but they improperly (or not at all) implement what should be done in case of an error (to inform the router about the error and to try again). So, once again, the best we can end up doing with cures we do not understand how they work is to alleviate the symptoms, and not actually curing the disease. I do not think that "Well, we are not sure if this will work, but we have good reasons to think it won\'t make things worse." is good enough reason to justify coercion by the government. Furthermore, it is unclear what "safely restarting the computer" would be if applied to the society.'

      'Somebody who knows basic robotics might conclude that, since, for example, the Ziegler-Nichols method of tuning PID-controllers can be used to regulate a wide variety of systems regardless of how those systems function inside (it does not matter if they are electrical or mechanical), it is not important to know details about how the economy works in order to usefully regulate it. But that is an incredibly inappropriate analogy. First of all, the systems we are dealing with in basic robotics have nothing in themselves to regulate themselves. Economies, just like human bodies, have those things, and government actions are usually going against them. If human bodies had no way of dealing with excessive blood, that is converting erythrocytes to bilirubin, perhaps bloodletting would help quite a few times, but human body does have a way of doing it on its own, and, when medieval physicians thought they knew better than the body, they were wrong. Also, in basic robotics, we know exactly what we want to achieve and how to measure how far we are from there. To usefully regulate the economy, we would need to precisely know things such as the velocity of money, which are difficult to even estimate. And, most likely, we would need to precisely know some other variables we do not yet know exist. Ancient physicians did not understand why sometimes bloodletting alleviates the symptoms and why it usually does not, because they had no concept of high blood pressure (also note that high blood pressure has very similar symptoms to low blood pressure, making it hard to diagnoze the actual problem even if you know about high blood pressure, so long as you have no instruments to actually measure it). Similarly with blood transfusion, Incas noticed that it sometimes cures the disease and used it regularly in spite of the fact (which should have been obvious) that it usually makes things worse, because they had no concept that different humans have different and usually incompatible types of blood. This leaves the question in the air, even if we take for granted Roosevelt\'s New Deal policies ended the Great Depression (and it is possible, given what we know, they made it worse)... does that actually mean similar policies would help us with modern-day economic depressions? I think that it does not mean that, for the same reason as blood transfusion once having cured some disease does not mean it will not make things worse next time, because of some factors Incas who practiced blood transfusion were unaware of (such as blood types). Also, when dealing with basic robotics, we very soon receive unambiguous feedback in case our method of regulating is actually counter-productive. The same is not true when trying to regulate the economy, and there is perhaps no better example than the US government in the 1920s trying to increase the standard of living by doing nothing about and even encouraging (by breaking its own law of the Gold Standard, not printing money even if more gold was available) massive deflation of the US dollar, in a false belief that prices would continue falling faster than wages. At first, of course, it seemed to work... until many businesses went bankrupt... but, then, it is hard to realize that policy which appeared to work for more than a decade is actually the cause of the problem. It is hard to imagine something like that happening in robotics, but that is what happens in politics. "Following the science" in politics should mean "There is overwhelming evidence this policy will be beneficial, as well as a widely-accepted scientific explanation for how it might. Therefore, we should implement that policy.". Unfortunately, what politicians usually mean when they say they follow the science is either "I was just mindlessly following orders." or "Here is a shotgun idea that seems somewhat plausible given some scientific theory, let\'s force everybody to participate in a poorly-designed and unethical experiment to test it.". And sometimes this is, unfortunately, also what advertisers for private business mean. You know, when companies making dog food made a guess that a grain-based diet for dogs would be a cheap but nutritionally adequate diet, causing countless heart attacks in dogs via lack of arginine until it was found the amino-acids essential for dogs are not the same as those in humans? They claimed to be following the science, when, in reality, they were indirectly forcing countless dogs to participate in a poorly-designed experiment.'

While not all economists agree with that, hardly any economist would agree that agricultural subsidies are a cost-effective policy. Even if they make food slightly less expensive, which is itself dubious, they undoubtedly increase the taxes, and almost no economist thinks they make food so much less expensive to be worth those taxes. Furthermore, even if they did decrease the price of subsidized food, that is not necessarily a good thing, because decreasing the price of milk and sugar will almost certainly drive the healthcare costs up.

Or the similar argument against vegetarianism \"<i>If we all adopted a primarily grain-based diet, we may even end up killing more animals, because machines that harvest crops tend to kill many rodents.</i>\". Implication, of course, being that the meat industry we have today is not responsible for deaths of countless rodents, which is obviously false. Perhaps the funniest (and the saddest) example of this way of thinking is that, when you ask people who advocate for a switch to grass-fed cows what is to be done about the fact that grass-fed cows emit around 3 times as much methane per pound of beef as grain-fed cows do, they often respond with \"<i>Well, there are bacteria that both digest cellulose and are able to use up to 90% of the methane they generate for energy. Perhaps we can genetically modify them so that they can be in symbiosis with cows.</i>\". Like, do people who say that claim to have a solution that works now, or a solution that might work 100 years into the future?

Real-world solutions are always inferior to vaguely imagined unicorns that exist in peoples' heads. And I say vaguely imagined because they are indeed vaguely imagined. Ask somebody who is advocating a switch to pasture-raised cows an obvious question such as what is to be done about poisonous plants, and they will probably have no answer. Ask somebody who is advocating technocracy how we can make sure the govenrment actually follows the consensus in social sciences, and you will probably get no answer either. In short, people are often pretending government we have today solves problems it actually does not even attempt to address (<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"if (document.getElementById('social_sciences').style.display=='none') document.getElementById('social_sciences').style.display='inline'; else document.getElementById('social_sciences').style.display='none';\">show/hide a rant about social sciences</a>)." +
    "<span id=\"social_sciences\" style=\"display:none;\"><br/>And let's say, for the sake of argument, that we have a form of government that guarantees it's the social scientists who make political decisions, rather than people ignorant of social sciences. What makes you think things would go well? Do you think we can trust social sciences enough for that? I have some idea about social sciences, as I have published some papers about linguistics, about my <a href=\"toponyms.html\">alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia</a>. Based on what I have seen, I would say social sciences have very little to say about politics. Linguistics has little to say about whether it is politically a good move to claim Croatian and Serbian are a different language. It seems to me most linguists inside Croatia think it is, whereas most linguists outside of Croatia think it is not, but that neither of that is based on evidence. Most linguists think it is a good thing to try to preserve nearly-extinct languages, such as Istriot in Croatia. But that also does not appear to be based on evidence. What makes you think economics is different? In case there is some ambiguity, I am not saying social sciences are without merit. I am saying the parts of the social sciences that deal with political issues tend to be without much merit. Microeconomics, based on what I know, probably has much more merit than macroeconomics. Microeconomics can be studied empirically and is not related to politics. Macroeconomics is politicized and is very hard, if not impossible, to study empirically. Social scientists sometimes do worse than average people in predicting politics. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_of_the_collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union#Why_were_Sovietologists_wrong?\">almost no social scientist thought the Soviet Union would collapse</a>, but some (very few, but still a noticeable number) people who were not social scientists did. Social scientists really do not have a good track record when talking about politics. And that's recent history. Social sciences have not changed much since then. Of course, further back in history you go, the worse it gets. Most social scientists at the time, just like most people at the time, thought World War 1 would not be nearly as bloody as it turned out to be and believed that it would end all or nearly all wars. I generally don't agree with Greta Thunberg, but I like how she said that economists that they talk about fairy tales of eternal economic growth (economists are arguably far more optimistic about economy than other people), and when those fairy tales prove false, they fail to agree what caused a recession. Well, that is almost the opposite of science. I don't know how to make social sciences better. Many people say social sciences rely too much on statistics and too little on common sense. I do not agree with that. In fact, in my alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia, I did some statistical calculations which include the Shannon's entropy and collision entropy (which is rarely done in that part of linguistics). But we need to stop pretending that we have indisputable sciences which tell us what people should be forced to do. Because we do not. So, I don't think social sciences are scientific enough to justify taking away peoples' freedoms. Especially not those parts of social sciences that are usually cited to justify that.<br/>" +
    'From my experience from social sciences, here are some things which can easily happen when you study them, which I assume do not happen nearly as often in natural sciences:<ol><li>You see some pattern in the data and you convince yourself it cannot be due to chance, even though you have no idea how to calculate it. And, indeed, for the pattern I have found in the Croatian toponyms, that first two consonants in river names tend to be <i>k</i> and <i>r</i>, respectively, you need to do birthday-paradox calculations, but where the number of people who share the same birthday is greater than two. There does not seem to be a way to solve that analytically, and not every social scientist knows programming enough to solve it numerically. That is not to say you will always be wrong in thinking something is unlikely to be due to chance, but, quite a few times, you will be.</li><li>A simplistic model convinces you some pattern you are seeing is unlikely, when it is not nearly as unlikely. This has happened to me at first. If you assume the language has 20 consonants which occur approximately equally often, the probability of the pattern I noticed occuring naturally is less than 1/10\'000. Similarly, the experiments I have made to test how well the algorithm I implemented in <a href="etymologist.html">Etymology Game</a> predicts phonological evolution of languages suggest it predicts around 16.7% better than chance. Namely, my algorithm correctly predicted the phonological evolution of a word from real-world data <a href="validation_results.html">0.56%</a> of the time, whereas a control algorithm predicted it correctly <a href="validation_of_control_algorithm.html">0.4797%</a> of the time. Does that mean that my algorithm does 0.56 / 0.4797 - 1 = 16.7% better than chance? Or are the results mostly an artifact of a simplistic control model, which quite often <i>predicts</i> the word would evolve into words which are probably unpronounceable in any language, such as <i>ghghad</i> and <i>krzkd</i>? It is hard to tell.</li><li>You are using a relatively complicated model, which makes intuitive but wrong assumptions. This has happened to me as well. If you use a model that tries to estimate the probabilities using the Shannon\'s entropy instead of the collision entropy (under an intuitive assumption that those two entropies will be approximately equal for human languages), it will tell you the probability of the pattern I noticed occurring by chance is around 1/500. Well, now I think, once I researched that more, that it is around 1/17 (5.9%). Realizing that required fixing a <a href="toponyms.html#correction">hard-to-find bug</a> in my program which I used to test my idea that Shannon\'s entropy of human languages would be approximately equal to the collision entropy. Similarly, as I explained in my <a href="Fonoloska_evolucija_jezika.docx">paper about Etymology Game</a>, on page 20, my model assumes languages respond to hard-to-pronounce consonant clusters at the end of a word by adding a paragoge vowel after the consonant cluster (for instance, that Proto-Indo-European word for the number seven, <i>*septm</i>, is likely to evolve into something like <i>*sepetme</i> or <i>*sepatma</i>), even though the real-world data suggests they generally respond by inserting an epenthetic vowel right before the last consonant in that cluster (like Latin <i>septem</i>). Thus my model gives precise (probabilities as numbers), complicated (it is programmed to do something, rather than nothing or behaving by chance, in such situations), but worse-than-chance predictions for how such words will evolve.</li><li>You get accused of talking gibberish because social scientists apparently cannot understand your mathematics. As has happened to me multiple times, like when I shared some of my ideas on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/n2hw22/entropija_dijelova_gramatike_hrvatskog_jezika/">Reddit</a>.</li><li>You deal with data which have been falsified for political or other purposes. Although this hasn\'t been my experience, it is arguably only because I was doing linguistics, which is less politicized than other social sciences. Social scientists often say they are able to tell apart gibberish from actual data. But it is clear that, at least sometimes, they cannot. For example, the Voynich Manuscript in linguistics. Is it a real language, or is it (at least mostly, as in being a steganography) meaningless? Linguists disagree on that, with some claiming they are able to assign probable meanings to certain words from it (or do statistical analyses suggesting it is a real language), and others arguing statistical analyses show it is not a real language (and showing a simple algorithm by which a medieval person could produce such a text).</li></ol>If something is hard to do properly, that means that, with few exceptions, it is not done properly. So, should we let that kind of science control our society? I do not know about you, but it does not seem like a good idea to me.<br />' +
    'Yet, it seems to me that this kind of science has a huge impact on our society. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a good example of that. Some studies that were used to justify lockdowns make the first mistake I mentioned, such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945e1.htm">Delaware study</a> (There is no attempt to calculate the p-value there. Nor is there a discussion why there was also a drop in mortality in the pre-lockdown Sweden at the same time, which, if you ask me, strongly suggests the drop in mortality in Delaware had much more to do with seasonality of COVID-19, the UV light from the Sun in summer killing the virus and Vitamin D deficiency being much lower in summer, than with the lockdowns.). Thankfully, such <i>studies</i> seem to be rare and not to have much impact on politics. But studies using computer models have had a lot of impact on policies. Studies predicting millions would die in the US or in Europe without lockdowns generally seem to make the second mistake, using simplistic computer models. Most such computer models made very simplistic assumptions both in terms of social sciences, and in terms of natural sciences. Namely, most such studies assume everybody who carries COVID-19 is equally likely to infect somebody else, whether or not they have symptoms. This assumption is obviously false, as one who coughs emits a lot more droplets with viruses into the air than one who just breathes (to say otherwise is to imply that vaccines that reduce the symptoms don\'t lower the transmission). Scientists who wrote those studies presumably thought the errors would somehow cancel each other out, which, as later studies demostrated, they did not. In terms of social sciences, those studies assumed the behavior of people would not significantly change just because they know about the pandemic. As recent history has taught us, that assumption is also wildly wrong (Many restaurants bankrupted in pre-lockdown Sweden because people were afraid to go to restaurants. And the behavior of people did not significantly change after the end of lockdown and mask mandate in Texas.). To give you some perspective on just how wrong those early computer models were, the model that was used to justify lockdowns in the US predicted that <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/imperial-college-model-applied-to-sweden-yields-preposterous-results/">96\'000 people would die of COVID-19 by May 2020 in Sweden</a>. And, as of May 2021, there have been 14\'000 deaths with COVID-19 in Sweden (Whether or not <i>deaths with confirmed COVID-19</i> is a good proxy for <i>deaths from COVID-19</i> is a complicated question. The usual argument for using that as a proxy is that there are presumably many deaths from undiagnosed COVID-19, so that those two errors presumably cancel each other out. But that makes sense only at the beginning of the pandemic. Now that we have vaccines that, according to rigorous studies, reduce the chance of dying from COVID-19 to basically 0, but do not provide sterilizing immunity, as vaccines for many diseases unfortunately do not... How does it make any sense to assume deaths of people who are vaccinated but who happen to carry COVID-19 at the time of their deaths are mostly deaths from COVID-19? Is it possible, if not probable, that the Chilean Vaccination Paradox and Israeli Vaccination Paradox are statistical illusions created by assuming deaths with COVID-19 are a good proxy for deaths from COVID-19?). Predictions that lockdowns would save millions of people arguably fall into the third category. They make an intuitive assumption that, if you close most businesses, people would respond by staying at home. But recent history has taught us that is not what happens. When lockdowns were first implemented, many people were rushing into grocery stores buying unreasonable quantities of everyday products, making the stores more crowded. And there were massive protests that probably would not have happened if there were no lockdowns. Furthermore, deaths from traffic accidents turned out to paradoxically be more common in places with lockdowns than in places without them. Not remotely like the computer models assumed. It is hard to deny poorly-done social science played a major role in recent politics.<br/>' +
    "To be clear, I am not saying I know the Swedish model of dealing with a global pandemic is the best. I am not certain of that, because it is hard to research that. The anti-lockdown movement is just as full of faulty science making grotesquely wrong predictions. For example, in summer 2020, when COVID-19 rates were very low, an Oxford study led by Sunetra Gupta analyzed blood samples of some random people and concluded that around 70% of people have already survived COVID-19, mostly having no symptoms, and that we have probably reached herd immunity. That study made a bunch of unjustified assumptions, mostly in natural sciences (how to properly determine whether somebody has survived COVID-19 from a blood sample, that having survived COVID-19 provides a near-absolute immunity from it, that 70% of the population being immune is enough for herd immunity...), and, as we now know, made grotesquely wrong predictions. The reason COVID-19 was so low in summer was not herd immunity, but the UV light from the Sun destroying the virus, as well as people probably spending less time indoors during the summer. And, in the autumn 2020, even more people died from COVID-19 than in spring that year.<br/>" +
    "It is hard to figure out the truth about COVID-19. But the true nature of modern-day social sciences is very visible if you try to. Social sciences, as well as scientific fields that combine natural and social sciences, are making mathematically precise but grotesquely wrong predictions and, when it becomes obvious they are wrong, they whitewash those predictions. Not too different from conspiracy theorists. In fact, social sciences and fields that combine social and natural sciences may even be worse than conspiracy theories, in the sense that conspiracy theories do not tend to make precise predictions, but instead conspiracy theories tend to rely on ad-hoc explanations on why they cannot be confirmed. In social sciences and fields that combine social and natural sciences, the mathematics there and precision of the predictions give you false confidence they are correct. When it turns out those predictions are not correct, you get, at best, a post-hoc explanation, if not an outright attempt to whitewash those predictions (which, unfortunately, seems to be what is happening with obviously-false predictions about the COVID-19 pandemic). Social sciences and fields that combine social sciences with natural sciences are making falsifiable and possibly even scientific (though I am not so sure they tend to be scientifically reasonable, as they seem to make obviously-dubious assumptions about both social sciences and natural sciences in their calculations) predictions, but they do not act the way real science does when those predictions end up being obviously wrong. That is probably worse than most forms of pseudoscience, including conspiracy theories. And that undeniable fact is, I think, an excellent argument against technocracy.<br/>" +
    "I am not sure about this, but I think that epidemiology has had quite a bit of hidden racism (or at least nationalism) in it during the COVID-19 pandemic. Why all those assertions about the Chinese vaccines, based on dead viruses, being less effective than mRNA vaccines made by European companies? What is the scientific basis for that claim, especially considering the Turkish study finding Chinese vaccines to be as effective as European ones? There is a clear scientific explanation for why vaccines provide better immunity against COVID-19 than having survived COVID-19: COVID-19 attacks lymph nodes stifling the production of antibodies, and studies consistently show vaccinated people have around 8 times more antibodies against COVID-19 than people who have survived COVID-19. But, obviously, no COVID-19 vaccine attacks lymph nodes stifling the production of antibodies, so the reason to believe not all vaccines are equal is... what exactly? I see no scientific reason to believe that, but I do see a political motivation to claim that. I do see a scientific reason to claim that mRNA vaccines are safer (but not more effective) than dead-virus vaccines, but it is the same kind of reason doctors 100 years ago had to (wrongly) claim ingesting butter or margarine was safer than ingesting eggs. We are comparing things which have no track record (that are mRNA vaccines) with things that have almost-stellar track record (that are dead-virus vaccines), and any comparison about long-term safety is therefore speculatively theoretical.<br/>" +
    'Anyway, why I think technocracy is bad... Well, if you believed the predictions of the simplistic computer models that hospitals would be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, the US policy of putting COVID-19 patients into nursing homes (that policy was suggested by <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2021/04/28/nyregion/cuomo-aides-nursing-home-deaths.html">Andrew Cuomo, who was later found to be involved in a scandal where the US government made it look like fewer people died from COVID-19</a>) is at least understandable, whether or not it is justifiable (I do not think it is ethical to intentionally kill grandmothers even if consequences for younger people were positive.). The policies of closing schools and not letting children visit their parents in prisons (as <a href="https://euobserver.com/opinion/148385">Croatia and Sweden have been doing</a>) are a lot more easy to justify if you believe the predictions of simplistic computer models that schools are the main way the pandemic spreads (children getting infected in schools and then infecting their parents and grandparents) than if you look at the incredibly messy real-world data (My understanding is that some studies from the Spanish Flu pandemic, back when epidemiology was in its infancy, suggested closing schools helps flatten the curve of the pandemic, but that no empirical studies done in this pandemic, now that studies are much more rigorous, suggest that.). If you look at the real-world empirical data, closing churches (where elderly people, who are much more likely to have symptoms and spread COVID-19, gather) probably makes more sense than closing schools, but almost no government has done that. If you believe shutting down most stores except the essential ones results in people staying home, as the simplistic computer models suggested, perhaps doing that is justified. But given that it results in mass panic of people rushing into grocery stores and buying unreasonable quantities of everyday products, leading to people being forced to buy in overcrowded stores and shortages of everyday products, it is hardly justifiable. Not to mention there have been quite a few dangers in the pandemic that computer models had no hope of predicting. In Texas, when the cooling system of the nuclear power plant stopped working, <a href="https://www.powermag.com/power-industry-pleads-for-priority-covid-19-testing-ppe-for-mission-essential-workers/">almost all the workers who were supposed to be there were infected with COVID-19</a>, and, if it were not for the modern automated safety systems (had they also failed), we would have probably had another Chernobyl. No matter how science-based as governments have recently tried to be, the society was not properly prepared for the dangers of the pandemic. It is instinctual to think the best way of dealing with an invisible enemy is to have a technocratic government trying to follow the science. But the evidence for that is thin at best.<br/>' +
    "As for the fifth type of problem in social sciences, of dealing with wrong data... Don't you think it is possible, if not probable, there were many Andrew Cuomos around the world, most of them not being detected? Clearly, it is possible to cover up half of the COVID-19 deaths in New York for months, so why it wouldn't be possible to do elsewhere for a much longer period of time? Excess mortality in Belarus, for example, is significantly higher than reported deaths with COVID-19, whereas it is the other way around in the vast majority of countries. And the data about China also seems very suspicious. I understand that there are many things that go in favor of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand that China had, unlike most other countries, organized food and grocery deliveries so that people there did not have to spend time in overcrowded stores to buy food and basic necessities. I understand that home ownership there is high, and different parts of families are mostly living in different houses, so that one person getting infected does not infect the whole family. I understand that the population there is young, and that the vast majority of people who die from COVID-19 are elderly. I understand China is not as plagued by heart disease and type-2-diabetes as most other countries are, the diseases which make COVID-19 deadly. But the government statistics showing less than 10'000 deaths are just unbelievable even when you take those things into the account, are not they? I mean, those things seem to have little or no effect in other countries.<br/>" +
    'Wouldn\'t a scientific way of dealing with a pandemic be to first try to explain the data we have, and only then implement policies based on those analyses? The countries most affected by the pandemic were the US and Eastern Europe. But why? I have (and everybody has) heard countless supposed explanations for COVID-19 mortality differing between countries, and, for every single one of them, just eye-balling the data makes it obvious it is not a true explanation. The most common supposed explanations are non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates and lockdowns. Well, first of all, it hardly makes sense to try to put all non-pharmaceutical interventions into a single variable, it can obviously be lumping good and bad policies together. It can obviously be that masks mandates are effective (How do people actually behave when forced to wear masks? Do they keep them clean enough to be effective? Do they even cover their nose with them so that they can be effective?), but that lockdowns are not, or vice versa (the same is true for many things in social sciences, such as the Economic Freedom Index advocated by the Austrian School of Economics, that it lumps good and bad policies together). Second, Scandinavian countries have done far fewer non-pharmaceutical interventions than either the US or most countries in Eastern Europe, yet they have fared much better. US had 11% excess mortality in 2020, Sweden had only 1.5% excess mortality, whereas Norway, Denmark and Finland had lower mortality in 2020 than in 2019. Now, people would generally respond to pointing out that the correlation between non-pharmaceutical-interventions and COVID-19 is actually positive with saying "<i>Well, countries with lockdowns had more cases to begin with. You need to control for other factors.</i>". But the problem with that response is that it is unclear what those other factors might be. Of the most obvious other factors, none seems to be able to explain much. The difference in COVID-19 mortality between countries is caused by different life expectancies, countries with more elderly people will be hit more by the pandemic? Well, as appealing as this idea sounds, it is not supported by the data. Scandinavian countries have significantly higher life expectancy than the US or the Eastern Europe. And so does Japan, which also did not have many COVID-19 deaths, and neither did it have much non-pharmaceutical interventions (though more than Scandinavian countries). COVID-19 hits countries with highest heart disease and type-2-diabetes the most? Well, what about Sudan, the country plagued the most with heart disease and type-2-diabetes, but having almost no COVID-19? Clearly, that also plays a minor role, if it plays a role at all. Countries with highest vaccination rate have fewer deaths from COVID-19? Well, statistics (which I suppose are misleading, but, nevertheless...) show us otherwise. Countries which get more Sun (closer to the equator) have less COVID-19 because the UV light from the Sun kills the virus? Then how are Chile, Peru and Seychelles so plagued with COVID-19, in spite of being close to the equator? And, again, Scandinavian countries are far from the equator, yet many of them had negative excess mortality, and others had relatively little compared to other countries in Europe. Island nations tend to have much less COVID-19? Again, what about Seychelles? If you cannot explain those things, what gives you the right to implement your policies? This may sound similar to when saturated fat deniers say stuff like "<i>Nutritional science cannot explain why Inuits and Maasai used to have low rates of heart disease until their diet got westernised.</i>", but it is really completely different. We do not know with reasonable certainty what Inuit diet was before it got westernised nor how commonly they used to get heart attacks, so the correct response is that those statements are probably myths, and should be dismissed in face of evidence we have from large studies. You cannot do the same thing here. Perhaps to solve that problem, you need to look at the economic factors as well as the epidemiology. As the Croatian biologist <a href="https://twitter.com/gordanlauc/status/1406183830860578818">Gordan Lauc points out</a>, among the European countries, there is a 42% negative correlation between excess deaths in 2020 and GDP per capita. If you only follow the mainstream media, the suggestion that this plays a role seems absurd. However, as Gordan Lauc explains, most COVID-19 patients (with the probable exception of the most difficult cases) are more likely to survive if treated with expensive HFOT machines (high-flow oxygen therapies, that richer countries such as Switzerland relied on) than with cheap ventilators (the machines that attempt to do breathing for you and are usually used for patients suffering from paralysis, that poorer countries such as Croatia relied on for COVID-19 patients). Cheap ventilators have bad side-effects often killing the patient, expensive HFOT machines do not. Furthermore, in poorer countries in Europe, hospitals were already close to full before the pandemic came, so it should not be surprising they were overwhelmed when the pandemic hit the country causing mortality from other diseases to drastically increase. If that is true, that basically means that governments should invest more in healthcare and that it is too late to do anything significant once a pandemic is already there. Perhaps, when it comes to pandemics, as hard as it is to believe, money is life.<br/>' +
    'Citizens view governments as a good source of information on how to stay healthy. In reality, governments should be viewed as something that is perpetuating useless and sometimes even harmful myths about how to stay healthy. During the HIV outbreak, Reagan administration responded first by denying the mere existence of HIV (saying that "gay plague" has to be a joke), and then by recommending useless mask wearing and glove wearing, and recommending that restaurants do not serve homosexuals. Now that we know more about HIV, those responses seems beyond absurd. Mask wearing does nothing to stop HIV, and neither does social distancing, because HIV is not spread by droplets. While it is plausible that masks help against COVID-19, because it is mostly spread by droplets (although it also has some capacity for airborne spread, against which masks which are commonly worn can do nothing), there is not much evidence of that. The Center for Disease Control in the USA at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was recommending regularly disinfecting the surfaces, only to <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2021/04/08/health/coronavirus-hygiene-cleaning-surfaces.html">later admit disinfecting the surfaces is unlikely to have saved anybody from COVID-19</a>. Also, before the COVID-19 pandemic, Croatian government was recommending people not to eat outside to avoid getting infected by insects, and it was forbidden for restaurants to serve food on terraces. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants could, if anything, serve food on the terraces, so that the UV light from the Sun would destroy the viruses. You do not need to be an epidemiologist to understand that at least one of those advices then contradict epidemiology (presumably the older recommendations, since, as far as I know, no epidemiologist was consulted before making them, while many epidemiologists from many countries seem to agree on the newer ones). And sometimes governments appear to be outright lying about public health issues. For instance, the government of Neatherlands is telling young people <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2021/07/18/partygoers-suffering-long-covid-dancing-janssen-can-sue-govt-urgenda">it is safe to dance in a nightclub immediately after being vaccinated with Johnson&amp;Johnson (Janssen) vaccine</a>. That is not true, COVID-19 vaccines only start working some 2-4 weeks after the vaccination (and even then, it is hardly responsible, because vaccinated people can and do transmit the virus, and vaccines do not reduce the chance of elderly people dying from COVID-19 quite to zero, for example, a vaccinated 75-year-old is about as safe from COVID-19 as an unvaccinated 50-year-old is). I understand the problem the government of Neatherlands is trying to solve, that they are trying to motivate young people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and counter the anti-vaccination movement popular in Europe. But attempting to counter anti-vaccination movement with misinformation to make people think vaccines are more effective than they actually are is arguably unethical and can easily backfire.<br/>' +
    'It should not be a question whether social sciences and fields which mix social sciences and natural sciences fail us badly (as they clearly do), but why they fail us so badly. The economist Thomas Sowell speculates, and the linguist Noam Chomsky has said a similar thing multiple times, that it has to do with how different the ways of evaluating ideas in social and natural (or for that sake, technical) sciences are. In natural and technical sciences, if you have some new idea, you can usually test it by an experiment, with little or no human factor in it. When I thought that I figured out a sorting algorithm that might be faster than IntroSort (which is conventionally used in standard libraries of various programming languages), I <a href="AEC_specification#AdvancedArray">implemented it in my programming language</a> and very soon received unambiguous feedback from a computer that my idea was wrong, with next-to-no human factor in that feedback. However, when you have some new idea about social sciences, how do you tell whether it is true? Well, you usually first communicate with other social scientists about it. Like when I came up with an idea about how to say "<i>The Etruscan language died two thousand years ago and nobody understands it.</i>" in Etruscan, I asked a <a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/15564/how-would-you-say-the-etruscan-language-died-two-thousand-years-ago-and-nobody">question about it on a Latin language forum</a>, and that seems to be the only way to get closer to the truth. We cannot tell empirically whether those ideas of mine are true, because, well, there are no Etruscan speakers around. However, that method of telling apart true ideas from false ideas, by asking fellow intellectuals, is obviously worse at discriminating against appealing but false ideas than actual experiments are. That is why social sciences are much more full of appealing but false ideas than natural sciences are. Of course, there are exceptions. In mathematics, which is the hardest of hard sciences, there being no irrational numbers is an appealing but a false idea, and it is false not because of some empirical evidence, but because of a simple mathematical proof. And it was possible for me to empirically test my idea that my computer model would predict the evolution of languages significantly better than chance, because the historical data needed to test that was easily available to me, and not because of linguists complaining the assumptions I made in that model to not seem compelling. But, generally, that is how things in sciences go, and it is arguably one of the reasons, if not the main reason, why social sciences and fields which combine social and natural sciences fail us so badly: social sciences are bad at discriminating against appealing but false ideas.</span>';

In socialism, people are not greedy for money, but for political power. When some of them succeed, they end up hurting the society with bad policies.

      'It is often stated that regulations are necessary to make people safe in capitalism, since the big business does not care enough about the safety of the workers and customers. But, to paraphrase Milton Friedman, safety regulations are philosophically very unsound, because they are essentially putting a price on human life. Most people think it would be a bad thing to pass a law that forces car manufacturers to make rear airbags, because that would make cars significantly more expensive. But the obvious truth is, requiring cars to have ABS brakes also makes them more expensive. So where do you draw the line? The fact is, wherever you put the line, you are essentially saying human life has some price. Not to mention safety regulations might lull engineers into false sense of security, making them think it is enough to obey some essentially-arbitrary safety regulations. Regulations requiring animal testing of medicine have a history of both giving us false sense of security and false sense of danger. In the Cutter Vaccine Incident of 1955, a vaccine against polio was judged to be safe by being tested on monkeys, when it turned out to have horrible side effects in humans, because of which the vaccination program had to be aborted, and a massive distrust of vaccines started. The government, instead of responding by saying to themselves "Well, maybe animal testing is not a good principle." and stop requiring it, decided to add countless more regulations on top of the existing ones. On the other hand, it was once common knowledge Aspirin was dangerous for people with heart disease because it incresed the risk of heart attack in some animals. As it later turned out, it protects against heart attacks in humans. And it is probably impossible to estimate how many lives are lost due to life-saving medicine not getting on the market because it has bad side-effects in some animals, even though it would not have those side effects in humans. Proponents of government-mandated animal testing insist it is very unlikely penicillin would be banned if it was found today just because it is lethal to hamsters, because the experts can judge which data from animal testing is relevant and which data is not. How can we know that? And, even if that is true, how can we know the decisions are actually made by competent people? Given how much animal suffering government-mandated animal testing causes, and that it obviously delays life-saving treatment (as medicine still needs to be tested on humans), answers to those questions deserve a lot of scrutiny, and they seem not to get that scrutiny. Milton Friedman, when he said that thing about regulations being philosophically unsound, referred to the case of Ford Pinto. Engineers at Ford thought they came up with a brilliant way to make cars less expensive to produce. What the testing they had at the time did not reveal (and modern testing almost certainly would) is that the change they made to the fuel tank makes the car much more likely to catch fire in case of a rear crash. Many people were burnt alive because of that mistake. And the government responded to it by adding a ton of regulations about manufacturing of cars. An obvious question is what made the government think those regulations would have any positive effect. Did they think lawmakers knew better than engineers? Engineers have already learned the fact that what the engineers of Ford Pinto were doing to fuel tanks should not be done, and they learned it the very hard way. Expecting that thing to happen again just because there are no laws prohibiting that seems foolish and absurd when you think about that. Whenever some catastrophy happens because a private company has made an error, the government steps in with more and more laws claiming those laws will help. But there is usually little evidence those laws would have prevented that catastrophy from happening, and no evidence that those laws will have a significant positive effect in the future. Is there anybody who doubts the real reason why such things do not happen today is not us having more laws, but simply science having advanced? Back in the time of Spanish Flu, there were many bogus vaccines claiming to immunize people against the Spanish Flu, almost all of them based on the assumption the Spanish Flu is caused by some bacteria, most of those bacteria being, as we now know, actually harmless to humans. But, back in the day, it seemed probable those vaccines would really work. However, now we know different, we now know flu is caused by a virus too small to be visible by microscopes that existed back in the day. Back in 1955, it seemed that attenuated viruses being injected into us would make us immune not only to that virus, but also to closely-related viruses, with little or no side effects, especially if it works in animals closely related to humans. That was true for the smallpox vaccine, attenuated cowpox virus made people immune both to cowpox and to smallpox while causing little or no side effects, but it is not true for the virus causing polio. The reason such things such as those fake vaccines against Spanish Flu or the Cutter Vaccine Incident of 1955 do not happen today is simply that we know better. And it is thanks to modern science, not thanks to lawmakers. The problems related to that are probably too complicated for lawmakers with no expertise in natural sciences to fully understand. Like Ayn Rand said, we know lawmakers count for nothing and scientists count for everything, because, if lawmakers were sent back to ancient times, they would not be able to provide people there with any of the goods we have today, while scientists would be able to.'

      "It is often stated good conditions at work are human rights that capitalism infringes onto. But, as Milton Friedman said, for something to be a human right, it has to be applicable wherever humans may be. And if you put the laws about work conditions from a rich country such as the USA into Bangladesh, you would make almost every job in Bangladesh illegal. Clearly, they are not applicable there, so they are not human rights. And, yes, obviously, sometimes social and economic freedoms do indeed infringe upon human rights. But governments are almost always unwilling and probably unable to do anything about those things. Circumcising a non-consenting boy because your religion tells you to do so is arguably a violation of human rights. But almost no government does anything about that (and maybe doing something about that would do more harm than good). To the contrary, back when the physician and pseudoscientist John Harvey Kellogg had a lot of influence over the public health in the US in the first half of the 20th century, the US government was recommending circumcising boys without anaesthesia to supposedly prevent masturbation, because John Harvey Kellogg believed masturbation to be a cause of various illnesses. Arguably, the US government was abuser of human rights, rather than their protector. Perhaps people being free to eat meat infringes upon animal rights. But governments do little-to-nothing about that. And maybe that is even a good thing, because, as we have seen, bats being illegal to eat in China does not stop people from eating them. To the contrary, it makes bats which are eaten receive no veterinary care, leading to pandemics. As well, most governments around the world are actually doing policies which are supposed to make meat and milk cheaper. Whether or not they actually succeed at that (those policies probably result in making all food more expensive by increasing the price of arable land), it shows the governments are not even trying to address the problem. Government is often solving problems which exist only in our heads, because real-world problems are too complicated to be solved by a simple government intervention."

      'It is often stated that government is needed to protect the environment. The usual argument is that it is necessary because those who are least responsible for global warming, such as farmers in Kenya, will suffer the most from it. So, supposedly, rich countries should sacrifice their economies by passing laws against pollution in order to save those who need help the most. I think a good response to that argument is that passing laws against pollution does not actually make multinational corporations who are responsible for most of the pollution invest in air-cleaning technology, water-cleaning technology and low-greenhouse-gas-emitting technology, but instead it moves the problem into foreign courtyards. In response to environmental regulation, multinational corporations often respond by outsourcing the work that pollutes the environment the most to countries where those laws do not exist, and those tend to be poorer countries where air-cleaning and water-cleaning technology is not available, and healthcare for people who get ill from the pollution is also poorer. So, even as the politicians in rich countries feel like they are protecting people in poor countries by passing environmental regulation, in reality, they are probably doing the opposite. Before environmental regulation, rich countries, those in which communities can afford expensive air-cleaning and water-cleaning technology, as well as healthcare for illnesses caused by the pollution, were also those with most air pollution. Today, almost the opposite is true. Countries in the European Union who suffer from air pollution the most are Poland and Croatia, the situation in Poland being significantly worse. Croatia is the poorest country in the European Union, whereas Poland is somewhere in the low-middle. The governments in poorer countries are, of course, not willing to pass laws against pollution done by those multinational corporations because they like their tax money. So, while environmental regulation may be good in principle, I think that, in the current political climate, it is not only not accomplishing its intended goals, it is also hurting precisely those who need help the most. And, just like most regulation, it can have unintended consequences. It is hard to predict which products precisely will become much more inefficient to make, and therefore expensive, due to some seemingly-reasonable environmental regulation. Like Ayn Rand said, "Smog is bad for mankind. It does not cause death as people who push for more environmental regulation claim it does, but it still hurts us. However, that is a technological problem, not a political one. Even if smog did cause death, we must remember that life without technology itself causes death.". She was referring to the fact that, thanks to the technology we have today, climate-related deaths have been decreasing over time, rather than increasing. If we add new regulation, consequences are hard to predict, but it may very well result in more climate-related deaths due to life-saving technology not being available. Mother nature is hard to predict, and it is important to minimize our impact on it rather than try to change it to suit our needs. However, economy is even harder to predict (economics is a softer science than ecology is), and our attempts to modify it to suit the needs of us and the nature can even more easily backfire. I also find it ironic that we are living in a world which is supposedly greatly threatened by global warming, in which the governments are subsidizing basically any form of energy except the cleanest one that is the nuclear energy, yet environmentalists are usually begging for more government, rather than less.'

For most politicians, encryption is a tool for terrorists and paedophiles to hide which does not help an average person. In most countries, politicians are outright demanding tech-companies to scan our messages for terrorism and child pornography, apparently without realizing how easily things can go wrong with that. And some politicians, even in free countries, are explicitly suggesting technology should be used to implement censorship. The American politician Tucker Carlson said on Fox News he thinks cameras should be put in classrooms to punish teachers who criticize the US government. I think many politicians actually think that, but are not willing to say that loudly.

      'Many libertarians believe in the Austrian School of Economics, and that is the reason many people reject libertarianism. But, the truth is, one does not need to believe in the Austrian School of Economics to think government intervention in the economy is almost always a bad thing. Personally, I think Austrian School of Economics is pseudoscience. Austrian School of Economics, for example, says that people are not exploited on their jobs, because people are there voluntarily and can leave whenever they want. Well, clearly, sometimes, even in free societies, people are not voluntary on their jobs, in the sense that they cannot leave whenever they want. If you are a doctor or a firefighter, leaving your job because you are displeased with the conditions there can very well have terrible consequences not just for you, but also for people around you. And saying voluntary interactions between rational individuals always leads to good outcomes appears to contradict the basic game theory. I mean, is not a corollary of that, that the greedy algorithms would always produce just as good outcomes as algorithms that employ dynamic programming? The Austrian School of Economics explains away the failure of socialist regimes using what it calls the "Economic Calculation Problem". Economic Calculation Problem essentially claims that the complex problem of economic calculation with the incomplete data can be solved much more quickly and accurately if the system solving it is distributed (capitalism) rather than centralized (socialism). I think a good response to the Economic Calculation Problem is that it is not really corroborated by computer science. In computer science, there is a thing called The Problem of Hidden Terminal, which can be said to be the opposite of the Economic Calculation Problem. The Problem of Hidden Terminal occurs only in wireless decentralized networks, and it is a crucial problem in them that makes large decentralized wireless networks impossible. It is when computers in a network can more-or-less accurately estimate the amount of data that is currently being transmitted through the network, but they drastically underestimate the number of computers in the network (as they are behind some barrier or simply too far away for the signal from them to get to the computer), leading to computers refusing to do anything because they are mistakenly thinking the network is overloaded. Decentralizing the information about the state of the wireless network does not make it work better, it makes it work significantly worse, if at all. However, as far as I can see, you cannot make such a counter-argument to the Michael Huemer\'s argument for libertarianism, that governments are in the position of ancient physicians. Governments are not in the position of programmers. Programmers have at least basic understanding of how computers work internally, and computers actually follow the algorithms specified in the programs. We do not know remotely enough about social psychology to predict how people will behave in some new situations, and how the society as a whole will behave is even more of a mystery. So, I would discourage my fellow libertarians from using the Austrian Economics in arguments, as those arguments are unlikely to be convincing to educated people. However, that does not mean there are no excellent arguments against government intervention in the economy.'

      "I think one of the good arguments for libertarianism is that the need for centralization in computer science can often be circumvented well by some rather simple solutions. The ethernet networks, for example, bypass the need for a centralized server telling which computer is allowed to send its message at which time simply by, in case the network is overloaded, the computer having a message to send waits for a randomly chosen amount of time. And it is important that the amount of time to wait is actually randomly chosen because two computers accidentally chosing the same amount of time would lead to types of errors called livelocks. However, computers behaving unpredictably, just like humans would, paradoxically, avoids that problem. The need for a centrlized server with a clock to synchronize clocks of devices in WiFi networks is being avoided simply by each packet of information in WiFi starting with five alternating ones and zeros, which are used for synchronizing the receiver and the emitter. Makes you wonder if the things in the society which seem to require government actually just require people behaving intelligently rather than following stupid algorithms, right?"

Well, at the beginning of the World War 2, the UK and the USA were giving money to the Chetnik party, which turned out to be cooperating with the Fascists. Chances are, they just made the World War 2 even worse, at least on the territory of the modern-day Croatia. And what exactly did the NATO Bombings of Belgrade accomplish apart from killing hundreds or perhaps thousands of civilians? I see no reason to think that played a huge role in ending the war. However, I can see how that probably made Serbians distrust capitalism more, since the USA is, in minds of many people, synonymous with capitalism. The point is, if a super-power gets involved in a war, you can't expect it to have the information it needs to bring peace to people. And if it brings force without being guided (or, perhaps even more probably, being misguided), it is going to make things worse. It's as simple as that. And even if that superpower happens to have the right information (which is unlikely), there is no reason to think it will use it the right way: the decisions are, more often than not, made by politicians with no military experience "

Croatian media are full of stories of there being an imminent danger of the Bosnian Muslims or the Serbian nationalists attacking us, and that we need to invest more in the military. Are those stories credible? Look, I am Croatian, and I have no bright idea. I could think of some arguments why those stories might not be credible. First, they are sensationalist, so they are easily sold to the media. Second, there is a political incentive to make people believe those things, to justify the high taxes that make our country bankrupt, and to justify taking money from the funds of the European Union (that could probably be spent way better). And even if those stories are true, if there indeed are people who will conquer Croatia, how to actually decrease the number of victims? Will the attempt to fight decrease the number of victims? Or, maybe, just maybe, will it actually increase it? Sure, some military operations of the Croatian War of Independence, such as Bljesak (Flash) and Oluja (Storm), are widely agreed to have been one of the best-organized military operations in modern history. But such things are relatively rare. We need to also consider things that the Croatian military did wrong. Governments protecting us in case of a foreign invasion can only work if the military commanders are sane and competent people. Sometimes they are not sane. Slobodan Praljak, for instance, killed many people just because they were of different religion and later killed himself. Sometimes they appear to be incompetent, and to lull people into false sense of security. Perhaps the best example of military lulling people into false sense of security is Vukovar Massacre. Basically, a Serbian named \u0416\u0435\u0459\u043A\u043E \u0420\u0430\u0436\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0438\u045B organized an illegal army to attack a hospital at Vukovar, because it was supposedly filled with people fighting for the independence of Croatia (and therefore deserve to die). The Croatian military was present in the city, and people were certain they were safe from that illegal army. The suggestions about evacuating the hospital were scorned at. However, when the Croatian military leader present in the city, Mile Dedakovi\u0107, warned of the imminent danger, and the president Franjo Tu\u0111man promised to send him weapons (it is a bit <a href=\"https://www.24sata.hr/news/mile-dedakovic-trazio-pomoc-ali-tumana-nisu-htjeli-buditi-243737\">controversial</a> whether he even promised to send him weapons)... those weapons mysteriously disappeared. Needless to say, the illegal army killed many people, and the Croatian military ended up doing nothing but having lulled people into false sense of security. This reads like a poorly-written horror story full of plot holes. But you know as they say, reality is weirder than fiction because fiction at least needs to make sense to the author. Events during the war do not need to make sense to anybody, and the plans made by the government to keep its citizens safe in the case of foreign invasion often turn out to be gibberish. BBC news at the time even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2988304.stm\">suggested</a> the Croatian government let Vukovar Massacre happen on purpose. I do not believe that, but I cannot deny the Croatian government handled it worse than if they did nothing. Most people in Croatia agree that having weapons is not a right, but a privilege to be earned. Yet, somehow, most of them agree the Croatian government somehow deserves to have weapons. Well, I fail to see why. And I think all governments are like that. Sure, not all governments are equal. Varivode Massacre, committed by the Croatian government, is nothing compared to the Srebrenica Massacre, committed by the Serbian government. But which government that has existed for more than a few decades doesn't have dark history? Then, why would governments deserve to have weapons? So, if I, as somebody who lives in Croatia, don't know those things, how could some American politician know?</span>";

The danger of the current variants of COVID-19 is real, no need to imagine anything, and the danger of an HIV-like variant of COVID-19 is speculative. But at least it is hard science that such a danger could exist, whereas the danger of getting rid of nuclear weapons (that some psychotic military leader would attack us because of doing that) is a matter of softest of the soft sciences.'

      "One of the best quotes I've read about politics is that normal people, when considering a policy, ask whether it does good, and politicians are more likely to ask a different question, namely, whether it feels good. It probably feels good to punish the evil-doers with prisons and jails. But does it do good? It's hard to see how it could. I can see how people can think death penalty or gun control actually do good (at least until you look into what the gun control laws actually say, as most gun control proposals ban automated weapons, those that may actually come useful in self-defense when every second counts, while leaving the weapons that are actually used in mass shootings legal), but, let's face it, the evidence doesn't support that either. It probably feels good to boycott sweatshops and to punish nations with what you consider poor economic policies with embargos. But does it do good? It is hard to see how it could. People in poor countries are in sweatshops because they think they have no better alternative, and that is probably true for them. And embargos arguably hurt poor people in oppressive regimes the most, while doing little or no harm to people on power there. Those things feel good, but they do not do good. It feels good to legislate laws against abortion. But does it do good? Well, there are probably a few women who might change their minds because of those laws. But the vast majority of women who would otherwise do abortion legally would end up doing abortion illegally, risking their own life by that. It feels good to legislate minimum wage laws, thinking you are increasing the pleasure of the exploited. However, does it do good? Sure, a few workers, who had a wage slightly lower than the new minimum wage, will get a pay raise. But those that actually had very low wages, significantly lower than the new minimum wage, will end up losing their jobs because of the minimum wage, and so too will many people who would otherwise get an entry-level job lose that opportunity."

Schools often emphasize building self-esteem in children. While studies show it helps an average person, they also show it hurts those who need help the most. One cannot talk himself into mental health, and pretending that it can be done hurts those who need help the most. Or the child labor laws. Sure, laws against child labor might help a child whose parents are brainwashed into opposing education. But it will hurt those desperately poor families to which child labor makes a significant portion of income. Sometimes child labor is the only way for a family not to starve. Or the net neutrality laws. Sure, they probably help an average Internet user. But they put a burden on last-mile ISPs, and the people in remote villages who have no Internet access are hurt the most by the net neutrality laws. Similarly with laws regarding the quality of electricity. Laws demanding high-quality electricity might help people with complicated electronics that can indeed be damaged by brownouts or strong higher harmonics. But what about people who don't have any electricity in their houses and who just want to use electricity for light? Arguably, they are being hurt by those laws. Or the policies regarding the conservation of languages. We can discuss whether it is a good thing to have multiple languages in a society (personally, I do not think it is, as a lot of resources are spent on language learning and translation, not to mention multiple languages make it easier to implement censorship), but those policies undoubtedly burden the low-income people, as it is usually the low-income people who happen to know the nearly-extinct languages. In all those cases, while it is possible that government policies help an average person, they hurt precisely those who need help the most. Also, many countries these days have a more-or-less flat tax rate, but have free higher education. It is hard to deny this is basically taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich. People who have higher education tend to be significantly richer than people who do not, whatever be the reason. And making higher education free makes that inequality even larger, as well as increasing the taxes. As well, the stated purpose of the Andrew Cuomo's policy of putting elderly COVID-19 patients into nursing homes instead of to hospitals was to protect the young people from hospitals getting overwhelmed, at the expense of the elderly people. I see no reason to think it saved anybody, but it obviously hurt those who need help the most."

      'And about education... To put it brutally, schools are places where children are forced to learn to analyze poetry, to speak Latin, and that Jasenovac is anti-Croatian propaganda (that less than 100\'000 people died there, although even the statistics of the Paveli\u0107\'es regime itself tell us around 150\'000 people were killed in that concentration camp, and there are good reasons to think it was significantly more). Analyzing poetry and speaking Latin is useless at best, and I doubt it helps critical thinking. And the history (more like propaganda) children are taught at school is undoubtedly damaging to critical thinking. Most people reject anarchism because they think "Well, it is better to risk having a Holocaust once in a century than to risk having tribal warfare every day.", not realizing Holocaust was not the only major atrocity that happened in the 20th century, or even the biggest one (Stalin and Churchill both killed more people than Hitler did, I do not think any serious historian would deny that), just because other atrocities committed by various governments are not even mentioned in history textbooks. The history that is taught in school prevents people from realizing just how inhumane governments can be, and that is why most people reject anarchism. It is easy to convince people to fight a hypothetical-at-best danger that is tribal warfare when they do not see the real danger that are genocidal or vastly incompetent governments. And, like I have said in my Pseudosciences page linked to the left, science that is taught at school can easily be worse than useless. Little knowledge can easily be worse than no knowledge. Teaching children that methionine is the most important amino-acid without which no protein can be synthesized, but not teaching them that methionine appears to somehow cause heart disease in humans even in amounts it is usually ingested these days, that is misleading children into damaging their health. Teaching children that antivirus programs protect computers from malware, but not explaining them that false-positives by antivirus programs can have just as bad effects as malware has, is misleading children into thinking antivirus programs are way more useful than they really are. Also, the history of science that is taught at school makes children susceptible to survivorship bias, as schools only teach success stories and almost no failure stories. In Croatia, we have a saying "Ne boj se nepismenih, nego polupismenih." (Do not be afraid of the illiterate, but of the half-literate.), yet schools arguably make people "polupismenih" (half-literate) about the vast majority of things they are teaching, but almost nobody makes that connection in their head. Nearly everybody wants people to have more education, primarily because there are many studies showing people with higher education earn significantly more. But like Bryan Caplan, and countless people before him, put it, there could hardly be a more misleading statistics. People who go to college are the people who did better in high-school, they tend to be more diligent and intelligent. If you put them in prison for a few years, rather than in college, chances are, they would still end up earning more than people who did poorly in high-school. And even if colleges do help people earn more money (which is by no means self-evident), how do we know that is because of the knowledge and skills gained at college, rather than because of virtue signaling that the diploma enables? Of course, it depends on the particular job we are talking about, and it is hard to determine. But if it is due to virtue signaling rather than knowledge and skills, a push for more education is analogous to forcing everybody at a sport event to stand up rather than sit down, so that they could supposedly see better. Just because if one person stands up, they sees better, it does not follow that if everybody stands up, they will see better, in fact, the opposite is true. Whether or not we should pursue more education is an incredibly complicated topic, and most people do not realize that. Whether or not the government should subsidize higher education is even more complicated, and it is obvious to me countless things could go wrong with that.'
