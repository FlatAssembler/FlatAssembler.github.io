        <br />There are statistics that show that governments (mainly socialism
        and communism) have, in recent times, killed many more people than
        murderers, or even wars, did. It's a phenomenon called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide">democide</a>.<br />
        <br />Some famous people that call themselves libertarians are the
        linguist Noam Chomsky and the Nobel-prize winning economist Milton
        Friedman.<br />
        <br />Somalia is often alleged to be evidence of the lack of a
        government causing violence. However, in 2004, after being stateless for
        more than a decade, its murder rate was less than half of the Africa's
        average murder rate.<br />

        The word "libertarianism" is defined as "a belief in human free will".
        Now, the phrase "belief in" has two quite distinct meanings: one is the
        belief that something exists, and the other one is the belief that
        something is reliable.

        In politics, it's mainly used in the second sense. Its basic principle
        (called non-aggression-principle) is that initiation of force is always
        immoral. The same applies to the things where other people believe that
        it's justified, like the police.<br />
        Libertarianism has a bad name. Its adherents are often said to be
        selfish and greedy. But the same is true for many other political
        opinions that aren't popular. That's because its arguments aren't
        communicated in a good way (they're often accompanied by things such as
        global warming denial), or worse, they aren't being communicated at all.

First, people back then had religions that commanded them to murder the infidels (<i>id est<\/i>, the people of other tribes) or do human sacrifices. Today, we don't have that. If we did, the government wouldn't be able to stop that violence. It isn't able to stop even the Islamic terrorists, yet alone transform the entire society of religious lunatics into reasonable and peaceful people. Second, today we have capitalism. If you have at least some money, it's usually much cheaper to buy something you need than to kill for that. It also usually makes it much cheaper to hire someone to work for you than to have slaves.

Also, how is it justice if there is basically 50/50 chance of getting away with murder? Justice is if willful actions have predictable consequences. Also, to quote Ayn Rand, we are living in a society where nobody knows first-hand what is legal and what is not.

Many international media reported when Croatia passed a law forcing the banks to forgive the debts of the poor citizens in 2015. What happened next to those banks? Well, some of them went bankrupt, and many poor people lost all their savings (the law guarantees us that, if a bank goes bankrupt, it needs to return the minimum of 100'000 euros and the amount of money on our savings, but there is no guarantee when it will happen).

Croatian media are full of stories of there being an imminent danger of the Bosnian Muslims or the Serbian nationalists attacking us, and that we need to invest more in the military. Are those stories credible? Look, I am Croatian, and I have no bright idea. I could think of some arguments why those stories might not be credible. First, they are sensationalist, so they are easily sold to the media. Second, there is a political incentive to make people believe those things, to justify the high taxes that make our country bankrupt, and to justify taking money from the fonds of the European Union (that could probably be spent way better). And even if those stories are true, if there indeed are people who will conquer Croatia, how to actually decrease the number of victims? Will the attempt to fight decrease the number of victims? Or, maybe, just maybe, will it actually increase it? Sure, some military operations of the Croatian War of Independence, such as Bljesak (Flash) and Oluja (Storm), are widely agreed to have been one of the best-organized military operations in modern history. But such things are relatively rare. We need to also consider things that the Croatian military did wrong. Governments protecting us in case of a foreign invasion can only work if the military commanders are sane and competent people. Sometimes they are not sane. Slobodan Praljak, for instance, killed many people just because they were of different religion and later killed himself. Sometimes they appear to be incompetent, and to lull people into false sense of security. Perhaps the best example of military lulling people into false sense of security is Vukovar Massacre. Basically, a Serbian named \u0416\u0435\u0459\u043A\u043E \u0420\u0430\u0436\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0438\u045B organized an illegal army to attack a hospital at Vukovar, because it was supposedly filled with people fighting for the independence of Croatia (and therefore deserve to die). The Croatian military was present in the city, and people were certain they were safe from that illegal army. The suggestions about evacuating the hospital were scorned at. However, when the Croatian military leader present in the city, Mile Dedakovi\u0107, warned of the imminent danger, and the president Franjo Tu\u0111man promised to send him weapons (it is a bit <a href=\"https://www.24sata.hr/news/mile-dedakovic-trazio-pomoc-ali-tumana-nisu-htjeli-buditi-243737\">controversial<\/a> whether he even promised to send him weapons)... those weapons mysteriously disappeared. Needless to say, the illegal army killed many people, and the Croatian military ended up doing nothing but having lulled people into false sense of security. This reads like a poorly-written horror story full of plot holes. But you know as they say, reality is weirder than fiction because fiction at least needs to make sense to the author. Events during the war do not need to make sense to anybody, and the plans made by the government to keep its citizens safe in the case of foreign invasion often turn out to be gibberish. BBC news at the time even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2988304.stm\">suggested</a> the Croatian government let Vukovar Massacre happen on purpose. I do not believe that, but I cannot deny the Croatian government handled it worse than if they did nothing. Most people in Croatia agree that having weapons is not a right, but a privilege to be earned. Yet, somehow, most of them agree the Croatian government somehow deserves to have weapons. Well, I fail to see why. And I think all governments are like that. Sure, not all governments are equal. Varivode Massacre, committed by the Croatian government, is nothing compared to the Srebrenica Massacre, committed by the Serbian government. But which government that has existed for more than a few decades doesn't have dark history? Then, why would governments deserve to have weapons? So, if I, as somebody who lives in Croatia, don't know those things, how could some American politician know?</span>";

        I hope the way I communicated the libertarian ideas made you think. I
        realize that they are hard to accomplish, because many people like the
        false sense of security and justice the laws give them. But the first
        step towards achieving some political goal is to speak out about it.<br />It's
        difficult to convince people to value freedom. It's much easier to
        convince them that giving up liberty somehow makes a society better.
        It's instinctual to think that taking away peoples' freedom and
        controlling what they do somehow makes them more economically efficient.
        That's why we had the things such as slavery, fascism and communism.
        Even when you do convince people to value freedom, there is often a
        state holding them back. For instance, the government was one who was
        putting the liberators of the slaves into prisons.<br /><br /><i
          >What happened to me so that I became a libertarian? Well, I realized
          that the government-backed-up pseudosciences destroyed my childhood
          and teenage years. After my parents got bitterly divorced, somebody
          from the social security (and I am quite sure I know exactly who, but
          I won't name them here) made up a story that my father was a rapist
          and that I was a witness. Since they were in the government, many
          people believed them back then, including my mother. Both my parents
          lost their jobs and gave all the money I was supposed to start my life
          with to lawyers. That story was well-known, and nobody wanted to be a
          friend with me. I was lonely (thankfully, I am an only child, so I
          didn't have to share this little money my parents were able to spend
          on me with my siblings), and I became a part of a group of vandals and
          alcoholics. Additionally, my mother ended up in jail for a year.
          Government might steal money from my fellow citizens and give it to me
          in compensation, but it cannot give me my childhood and teenage years
          back. Even today, I sometimes get asked whether there is some truth to
          that story about my father. Uncomfortable, I answer that there isn't,
          but that that story, because the government got involved, had very
          real and devastating consequences. I am no longer an alcoholic and a
          vandal, and I am relatively respected among the people who know me.
          But to prevent other people from getting into such situations, I want
          to send a message: "Don't ascribe superpowers to the people in your
          government." That means don't believe ridiculous conspiracy theories,
          but also don't believe that the government can do miracles to protect
          us.</i

        <br /><br /><b>UPDATE</b> on 14/07/2019: I've made a thread about
        libertarianism on a Latin forum, to see what people educated in history
        and social sciences think about it. You can see it

          >here</a
        >. In case that website ever goes down, here is that short essay in
        Latin I posted there:
        <div lang="la" class="quotation">
          Quid cogitatis de anarchismo? Ego anarchista sum, ego cogito melius
          esse, si imperia et leges non essent. Ego non video, quomodo possint
          bonae leges existere? Quomodo possint leges imperiaque societatem
          protegere? Consideretis: Nemo, qui non insanus est, vult aliquem
          occidere. Et militia venit solummodo postquam insanus homo occidat
          aliquem. Et tunc militia sinit eum insanum hominem in carcerem. Carcer
          non est (et probabiliter non potest esse) locus ubi is insanus homo
          sanus futurus est, carcer locus est ubi is plus insanus factus erit.
          Ergo, is insanus homo, qui suae insanitatis causa aliquem occidit,
          insanior revertetur in societatem.<br />
          Securitas, quae nobis data a militia est, falsa est. In saeculis
          historiae, etsi custodes et equites omnes spectabant et custodiebant,
          non poteras, viis in urbibus iens, securus a latronibus esse.<br />
          Et de rebus oeconomicis... Linguae videntur esse sine imperiis posse.
          Si linguae sine imperiis possunt esse, cur oeconomia non possit?<br />
          Et de rebus bellorum... Paene omnia bella horum temporum pugnae sunt,
          ut omnia bella cessent. Sed bella numquam bella inhibere succedent. Et
          tela solummodo raris temporibus veniunt ubi debentur, arma bonorum
          hominum saepe veniunt in malas manus.<br />
          Civitates amant falsam securitatem, quod leges et imperia dant eis.
          Difficile pugnare contra ei est. Multi homines censent libertatem
          civitates oeconomice parum strenuas facere, et quod libertas, quodam
          modo, facit homines res, quae non rationales sunt, facere. Id est cur
          habebamus Fascismum, Communismum et servos. Sed possumus sperare
          numerum eorum hominum, qui libertatem non amant, minorem in futuro
          esse.

        UPDATE on 22/09/2019: I've just posted a YouTube
        <a href="https://youtu.be/ES5hAc2fLWU">video</a> about pseudoscience in
        American politics. If you can't open it, you can perhaps try to open a
        low-quality MP4 <a href="At_AOC-minified.mp4">file</a> hosted on this
        server (it can be opened on almost any platform using VLC Media Player).
        Failing to do even that, you can probably download the MP3
        <a href="At_AOC.mp3">audio</a>.<br /><br />
        UPDATE on 20/10/2019: I've just posted a YouTube
        <a href="https://youtu.be/XxizDnTKBXI">video</a> about libertarian
        philosophy in Latin. If you can't open it, try
        <a href="DeAnarchismo-minified.mp4">this</a> and, if that also fails,
        download just the audio <a href="DeAnarchismo.mp3">here</a>. I've also
        opened a Reddit
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/e7v50t/a_video_about_anarchism_in_latin/"
          >thread</a
        >
        to discuss that video.<br />
        <br />UPDATE on 08/02/2020: I've posted a YouTube
        <a href="https://youtu.be/bM4IPsx_AEc">video</a> explaining why I think
        that, if you support free trade and free movement, you can't also
        support immigration restriction. If you can't open it, try to
        <a href="Immigration.mp4">download</a> the MP4 file.<br />
        <br />UPDATE on 23/02/2020: I've translated the lyrics a song called
        <a href="https://youtu.be/GP7rMdxX1gg">E Moj Plavi</a> (<a
          href="EMojPlavi.mp4"
          >MP4</a
        >) into English, which seems to express some libertarian ideas. (
        <i>
          UPDATE: I received a message from somebody claiming to be
          &#x0110;or&#x0111;e Bala&#x0161;evi&#x0107; about how my translation
          is offensive and asking me to delete all copies of it as soon as
          possible, or else he is going to make a lawsuit against me. While I
          find it just as believable it wasn't real &#x0110;or&#x0111;e
          Bala&#x0161;evi&#x0107;, but somebody who tries to shut him up, the
          risk of getting into such lawsuits is rather high. If it is him, it is
          sad that a singer who writes and sings anti-police songs will sue
          somebody for offensive speech, because it shows he does not actually
          believe what he preaches.
        </i>
        )<br />
        <br />UPDATE on 03/10/2020: I've translated a song against nuclear
        weapons into Croatian. You can see it on YouTube
        <a href="https://youtu.be/sakosp-5SsI">here</a>. If you have trouble
        opening it, try downloading this
        <a href="sun_is_burning_minified.mp4">MP4</a> and opening it in VLC
        media player (or something like that).
