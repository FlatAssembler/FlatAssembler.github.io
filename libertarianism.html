      <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px">
        <br />There are statistics that show that governments (mainly socialism
        and communism) have, in recent times, killed many more people than
        murderers, or even wars, did. It's a phenomenon called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide">democide</a>.<br />
        <br />Some famous people that call themselves libertarians are the
        linguist Noam Chomsky and the Nobel-prize winning economist Milton
        Friedman.<br />
        <br />Somalia is often alleged to be evidence of the lack of a
        government causing violence. However, in 2004, after being stateless for
        more than a decade, its murder rate was less than half of the Africa's
        average murder rate. Many say it is primarily because guns are hard to
        acquire there, though.<br />

        Now, the phrase "belief in" has two quite distinct meanings: one is the
        belief that something exists, and the other one is the belief that
        something is reliable.

        In politics, it's mainly used in the second sense. In fact, as a
        political libertarian, I am not even sure whether free will itself is an
        illusion, and that seems quite a bit irrelevant to me. The basic
        principle of libertarianism (called non-aggression-principle) is that
        initiation of force is always immoral. The same applies to the things
        where other people (libertarians call people who are not libertarians
        <i>statists</i>, from <i>state</i>, a rare word meaning
        <i>country</i> or <i>government</i>) believe that it's justified, like
        the police.<br />
        Libertarianism has a bad name. Its adherents are often said to be
        selfish and greedy. But the same is true for many other political
        opinions that aren't popular. That's because its arguments aren't
        communicated in a good way (they're often accompanied by things such as
        global warming denial, or nonsense and insulting phrases such as
        <i>all cops are bastards</i>), or worse, they aren't being communicated
        at all.

        I hope the way I communicated the libertarian ideas made you think. I
        realize that they are hard to accomplish, because many people like the
        false sense of security and justice the laws give them. But the first
        step towards achieving some political goal is to speak out about it.<br />It's
        difficult to convince people to value freedom. It's much easier to
        convince them that giving up liberty somehow makes a society better.
        It's instinctual to think that taking away peoples' freedom and
        controlling what they do somehow makes them more economically efficient.
        And maybe if human beings were perfectly rational and had access to
        perfect information (so that game theory could be used to model human
        behavior), these instincts would be correct. That's why we had the
        things such as slavery, fascism and communism. And violent revolutions
        are, exactly because of that, counter-productive. If the vast majority
        of people believe government is necessary for safety, overthrowing a
        government usually leads to an even more oppressive government forming.
        Even when you do convince people to value freedom, there is often a
        state holding them back. For instance, the government was one who was
        putting the liberators of the slaves into prisons.<br />
        Achieving libertarianism would require a giant paradigm shift in the way
        most people think about politics. People usually consider sovereignity
        of countries to be a good thing. Libertarians do not, we hate the idea
        that some fallible government should have absolute power. People usually
        consider equality before the law to be a good thing, except, in recent
        times, for vaccination companies. People have started to realize holding
        vaccination companies liable for incredibly rare (if real) severe
        side-effects of vaccination discourages investment in this essential
        business and does more harm than good. Hopefully people will soon
        realize the same is true not just for vaccination (<a
          href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/elon-musk-launch-regulations-broken-after-delayed-spacex-launch.html"
          >Elon Musk</a
        >, for example, seems to realize that, when he said that the only way to
        innovate in today's society is to ignore the laws and hope nothing
        happens to you because of that). Most people consider rule of law to be
        a good thing. But rule of law only makes sense if laws are good, and
        libertarians think the vast majority of laws we have are bad, and that
        it is a good thing they are not always enforced. Most people think
        corruption is always bad, that it is never a good thing if the
        government breaks its own laws. Libertarians think corruption is a
        symptom of a bigger problem of stupid senseless laws, and that
        eliminating the corruption while doing nothing about the underlying
        problem often does more harm than good.<br />
        People tend to think it is important who is on power, and that, if they
        were on power, things would probably be better. For example, people tend
        to describe Dalai Lama and Mao as mass murderers. In reality, if you
        were in their shoes, you would probably have done the same, afraid for
        your life and realizing how powerless you actually are. Imagine that you
        are Dalai Lama receiving a letter saying &quot;<i
          >We are about to do some ritual, and, for that ritual, we need
          this-many cut-off hands and this-many cut-off heads. Order your army
          to kill or mutilate some Chinese people to deliver that to us... or
          else we will kill you and replace you with somebody else.</i
        >&quot;. What would you have done? What would you have done if you were
        in Mao's shoes when he went to investigate reports of mass starvation in
        Henan, and people there replanted rice from multiple acres into one to
        make it look like the crops had not have failed? People who appear to be
        on power are usually powerless to change anything, and are often also
        unaware of what is really going on (or at least the extent of the
        problem). If the country you are governing had been struck by famine for
        decades, and there comes a biologist called Lysenko claiming to have a
        solution, and many (though not most of them) biologists agreed with him,
        there is a very good chance you would implement their policies much like
        Stalin and Mao did. When their country was plagued by the COVID-19
        pandemic, an illness with, at that time, no known cure or prevention,
        which appeared to mostly be spread by asymptomatic individuals while
        being very deadly to elderly people and other people with low immunity,
        and there was a group of scientists claiming that lockdowns and mask
        mandates could curb the pandemic, the vast majority of governments
        implemented policies similar to those that those scientists were
        suggesting. Obviously, those policies did not turn out to be nearly as
        harmful as Lysenkoism turned out to be (though, you cannot deny those
        warnings early in the pandemic, that suicide spikes caused by lockdowns
        might outweight any possible protection against COVID-19 that lockdowns
        could provide, were reasonable, after all, it seems now that they turned
        out to be true at least for teenagers), but they are similarly
        poorly-designed experiments (we still do not know beyond reasonable
        doubt whether they work) everybody was forced to participate in. Really
        makes you wonder how are most people today, including most politicians,
        really different from Stalin and Mao, does not it? Are modern
        politicians simply in different situations, rather than being
        significantly more competent and well-intentioned? Clearly, if their
        country is in some situation which seems hopeless, and there comes a
        group of scientists claiming without good evidence to have a solution,
        modern politicians are willing to force everybody to participate in a
        poorly-designed experiment to test whether that solution works. Yet,
        people seem to be obsessed with who is in power, as if that was likely
        to make a difference. The Croatian ex-prime-minister Ivo Sanader has
        been serving a sentence in Remetinec jail since 2012 for the abuse of
        power, and most people (at least those who have not been enough
        brainwashed by the right-wing propaganda to think the things he was
        convicted of did not actaully happen; I have asked a
        <a
          href="https://www.quora.com/Was-Remetinec-the-part-of-Zagreb-where-the-prison-is-in-which-the-Croatian-politician-Ivo-Sanader-is-serving-a-long-sentence-for-the-abuse-of-power-called-Remetinec-before-the-prison-Why-would-somebody-call-a-part"
          >Quora question</a
        >
        about that) think that happened only because we chose the wrong party at
        the election and that him ending up in jail is justice. In reality,
        justice would be if the society is structured so that such things cannot
        happen, and somebody else would have probably done the same if they were
        in their shoes. Restricting the government so it can do no harm is way
        more important than enabling it to do something good by forcing people
        to do things against their will. Such a paradigm shift in thinking, that
        people stop worrying about who is on power, and start worrying about
        what incentives people on power actually have, is hard to accomplish.

          >What happened to me so that I became a libertarian? Well, I realized
          that the government-backed-up pseudosciences destroyed my childhood
          and teenage years. After my parents got bitterly divorced, somebody
          from the social security (and I am quite sure I know exactly who, but
          I won't name them here) made up a story that my father was a rapist
          and that I was a witness. Since they were in the government, many
          people believed them back then, including my mother. Both my parents
          lost their jobs and gave all the money I was supposed to start my life
          with to lawyers. That story was well-known, and nobody wanted to be a
          friend with me. I was lonely (thankfully, I am an only child, so I
          didn't have to share this little money my parents were able to spend
          on me with my siblings), and I became a part of a group of vandals and
          alcoholics. Additionally, my mother ended up in jail for a year.
          Government might steal money from my fellow citizens and give it to me
          in compensation, but it cannot give me my childhood and teenage years
          back. Even today, I sometimes get asked whether there is some truth to
          that story about my father. Uncomfortable, I answer that there isn't,
          but that that story, because the government got involved, had very
          real and devastating consequences. I am no longer an alcoholic and a
          vandal, and I am relatively respected among the people who know me.
          But to prevent other people from getting into such situations, I want
          to send a message: "Don't ascribe superpowers to the people in your
          government." That means don't believe ridiculous conspiracy theories,
          but also don't believe that the government can do miracles to protect
          us.</i

          Quid cogitatis de anarchismo? Ego anarchista sum, ego cogito melius
          esse, si imperia et leges non essent. Ego non video, quomodo possint
          bonae leges existere? Quomodo possint leges imperiaque societatem
          protegere? Consideretis: Nemo, qui non insanus est, vult aliquem
          occidere. Et militia venit solummodo postquam insanus homo occidat
          aliquem. Et tunc militia sinit eum insanum hominem in carcerem. Carcer
          non est (et probabiliter non potest esse) locus ubi is insanus homo
          sanus futurus est, carcer locus est ubi is plus insanus factus erit.
          Ergo, is insanus homo, qui suae insanitatis causa aliquem occidit,
          insanior revertetur in societatem.<br />
          Securitas, quae nobis data a militia est, falsa est. In saeculis
          historiae, etsi custodes et equites omnes spectabant et custodiebant,
          non poteras, viis in urbibus iens, securus a latronibus esse.<br />

          Si linguae sine imperiis possunt esse, cur oeconomia non possit?<br />
          Et de rebus bellorum... Paene omnia bella horum temporum pugnae sunt,
          ut omnia bella cessent. Sed bella numquam bella inhibere succedent. Et
          tela solummodo raris temporibus veniunt ubi debentur, arma bonorum
          hominum saepe veniunt in malas manus.<br />
          Civitates amant falsam securitatem, quod leges et imperia dant eis.
          Difficile pugnare contra ei est. Multi homines censent libertatem
          civitates oeconomice parum strenuas facere, et quod libertas, quodam
          modo, facit homines res, quae non rationales sunt, facere. Id est cur
          habebamus Fascismum, Communismum et servos. Sed possumus sperare

                spiking there. Government is lying about how effective the
                vaccine is, so how can we trust them they are even safe?<br />

                <b>Croatian government</b>: Do not go dancing immediately after
                you get vaccinated. And do not drink alcohol soon after getting
                the vaccine, it can make the side-effects of vaccination worse.
                Vaccines only start working after 2 weeks, and in some people
                only after 4 weeks. And even then, it is hardly responsible to
                go dancing as long as the virus is circulating around. Getting
                vaccinated decreases your chance of spreading COVID-19 if you
                catch it only by around 45%, and there are still many
                uvaccinated vulnerable people around. Furthermore, vaccines do
                not exactly reduce the chance of vaccinated 75-year-olds dying
                from COVID-19 down to zero, they are about as immune as
                unvaccinated 50-year-olds are.<br /><b>Young people</b>: (<i

                the first place? I am very unlikely to get seriously ill from
                it. And who cares that the economy is suffering? At least the

        <br /><b>UPDATE</b> on 27/08/2021: I think I have figured out a nice
        response in case somebody on an Internet forum asks you to stop talking
        about politics. Say to them &quot;<i
          >OK, then, let's talk only about idiotic things. You know, Aristotle
          called all things not related to politics 'idiotic'.</i
        >&quot;. The joke is in that the word &quot;<i lang="el"
          >&#x03b9;&#x03b4;&#x03b9;&#x03bf;&#x03c4;&#x03b7;&#x03c2;</i
        >&quot;, which Aristotle did indeed use to mean &quot;<i
          >things not related to politics</i
        >&quot;, meant &quot;<i>private</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>one's own</i
        >&quot; in Ancient Greek, it is just that the word has changed its
        meaning over centuries drastically.
