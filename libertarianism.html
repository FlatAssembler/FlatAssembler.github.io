      <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px">
        <br />There are statistics that show that governments (mainly socialism
        and communism) have, in recent times, killed many more people than
        murderers, or even wars, did. It's a phenomenon called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide">democide</a>.<br />
        <br />Some famous people that call themselves libertarians are the
        linguist Noam Chomsky and the Nobel-prize winning economist Milton
        Friedman.<br />
        <br />Somalia is often alleged to be evidence of the lack of a
        government causing violence. However, in 2004, after being stateless for
        more than a decade, its murder rate was less than half of the Africa's
        average murder rate. Many say it is primarily because guns are hard to
        acquire there, though.<br />

        The word "libertarianism" is defined as "a belief in human free will".
        Now, the phrase "belief in" has two quite distinct meanings: one is the
        belief that something exists, and the other one is the belief that
        something is reliable.

        In politics, it's mainly used in the second sense. In fact, as a
        political libertarian, I am not even sure whether free will itself is an
        illusion, and that seems quite a bit irrelevant to me. The basic
        principle of libertarianism (called non-aggression-principle) is that
        initiation of force is always immoral. The same applies to the things
        where other people (libertarians call people who are not libertarians
        <i>statists</i>, from <i>state</i>, a rare word meaning
        <i>country</i> or <i>government</i>) believe that it's justified, like
        the police.<br />
        Libertarianism has a bad name. Its adherents are often said to be
        selfish and greedy. But the same is true for many other political
        opinions that aren't popular. That's because its arguments aren't
        communicated in a good way (they're often accompanied by things such as
        global warming denial, or nonsense and insulting phrases such as
        <i>all cops are bastards</i>), or worse, they aren't being communicated
        at all.

The police almost always only comes after a psychopath has already murdered someone. And then almost always they put him in a place not where he will rehabilitate, but to a place (prison or jail) from which he will return with even more psychological problems, that made him murder in the first place. For all we know, they could just be making things worse. In fact, the history appears to support the notion that the government attempting to prevent crime actually causes it. In the middle ages, the knights were bossing everyone around, yet you couldn't safely walk the streets because of the criminals. It has been noted since ancient times, by Lao Zi, that \"The more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers.\". Also, the US has the highest incarceration rate of all the countries in the world today (except possibly North Korea), almost 3% of its population is behind bars, yet it also has the most mass shootings per capita. If policing prevented crime, we would expect to see countries with higher incarceration rate and with more police shootings to be lower in crime, right? Yet, we do not see that, in fact, we see the opposite of that. It seems that the effect of policing that it provokes crime is greater than the effect of it deterring crime, or, at least, that factors other than policing play a much greater effect on crime and that the effect of policing on crime is negligible "

If people actually believed police keeps us safe, why don't they vote with their feet and move to the USA in search for a better life? Very few people move to the US in search for a better life, many more people move to Western Europe. It seems to me like people do not truly believe the things they claim to believe about politics.<br\/><span id=\"details\" style=\"display:none\">A common counter-argument is that there is evidence of at least some tribal societies being violent way before the rulers in today's sense existed, and that that's evidence that giving people too much freedom would lead to violence. But there aren't many reasons to think that would actually happen. First, people back then had religions that commanded them to murder the infidels (<i>id est<\/i>, the people of other tribes) or do human sacrifices. Today, we don't have that. If we did, the government wouldn't be able to stop that violence. It isn't able to stop even the Islamic terrorists, yet alone transform the entire society of religious lunatics into reasonable and peaceful people. Second, today we have capitalism. If you have at least some money, it's usually much cheaper to buy something you need than to kill for that. It also usually makes it much cheaper to hire someone to work for you than to have slaves. In fact, we can only speculate on what is the cause of war being more common before civilization, because we do not even know if that phenomenon is real. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marija_Gimbutas\">Marija Gimbutas<\/a>, one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century, famously argued <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-06-11-tm-2975-story.html\">world was at peace<\/a> before patriarchy came along with agriculture.

                  'In case there is any ambiguity, I am not saying I believe policemen are evil. Any more than you think (I hope) monks and preachers of religions you do not believe in are somehow evil. I think that policemen honestly believe they are helping the society. They probably think they are preventing recidivism and giving people a true sense of justice. But, like I think I have shown, recidivism is not something to worry about when it comes to murder and, even if it were, prisons would not be a solution (although death penalty might be). Also, how is it justice if there is basically 50/50 chance of getting away with murder? Justice is if willful actions have predictable consequences. Also, to quote Ayn Rand, we are living in a society where nobody knows first-hand what is legal and what is not. We have so many laws and they are so complicated that nobody can fully understand them. For laws to be just, an average person needs to be able to understand them. It is indisputable fact that, at least for some parts of the law, that is impossible. Some legal cases involving the tax on companies in the USA ended up in favor of companies not because they did not break the law, but because the court ruled it was beyond reasonable doubt impossible for the owners of those companies to know about that obscure tax and how to pay it. I think that is not only justice, but that it should be applied much further. Not to mention there is also a huge gap between what people think the law says and what it actually says. Copyright laws being the most obvious example. Most people think that, if there is no copyright licence on something, that means it is not copyrighted. In reality, a piece of software without a licence is implicitly "all rights reserved". So, how is it justice to punish somebody for having a common misconception about the law? People similarly tend to have misconceptions about what "free speech" means. Presumably most people think it means Twitter and similar services cannot ban you just for expressing a controversial opinion. In reality, they can, and courts protect them in that case. The term "free speech" does not refer to private companies at all, it is supposed to protect you from getting into jail just for expressing a controversial opinion. Except that, in reality, it does not even do that, it is basically a meaningless phrase. In September 2019, the Croatian journalist Gordan Duha\u010dek got into jail for complaining about the police brutality on Twitter, based on a law against apocalyptic preachers damaging public moral feelings by saying everybody is going to hell (but, apparently, anti-abortion activists saying exactly that do not end up in jail), and that law dates back from communism and predates Croatian constitution. To a layman, that sounds like a frivolous lawsuit, but, apparently, it is not. The Croatian singer Marko Perkovi\u0107 Thompson also got into legal trouble just because of the things he said about politics, and he barely escaped jail by paying a lot of money to lawyers. And, no, appealing to the constitution is not what saved him. The lawsuit was incredibly complicated, but it did not involve the constitution. Such things are incredibly rare, but the fact that they happen at all is problematic. Similarly, to a layman, government forcing everybody to participate in a poorly-designed experiment to see if lockdowns slow down the pandemic seems blatantly unconstitutional, as lockdowns restrict the freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, and are laws in favor of religions because churches were excempt from lockdowns (in spite of science being remarkably clear that churches, where elderly people gather, are far more dangerous than, for example, schools). Apparently, due to some legal mumbo-jumbo, unproven public health interventions can legally be enforced, no matter what the constitution says. In many countries (thankfully not in Croatia), many people got into jail simply for questioning the scientific validity of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns on social media, and many of those countries previously had a better track record of protecting free speech than Croatia had. So, how is enforcing this impossible-to-fully-understand system of essentially-arbitrary rules that are laws, under which you can end up in jail merely because you said something controversial, justice? It is not justice, and police officers are priests of a false religion most people are believers in.'

In other words, it is possible for a police officer who injures a shooter to prevent a certain mass shooting to get in jail because of that. The question is, of course, whether the presence of the police decreases the chance of a mass shooting occurring. Admittedly, I do not have hard data about that, but I expect the answer to be no. First of all, the corollary of that is civilians having weapons would also decrease the incidence of mass shootings, presumably even more so. Such a claim is considered insane by most Croatians. The public in the USA is obviously divided about that issue, but social scientists do not seem to be. The positions social scientists take seem to range between gun control (restricting civilian access to firearms) having no effect (that is the view I subscribe to, as it seems like a reasonable null-hypothesis when there is no good data, and, furthermore, most gun control laws are banning automated weapons, those that may actually come useful for self-defense when every second counts, while leaving weapons that are actually used in mass shootings legal) on mass shootings to it having a significant positive effect, significantly decreasing the incidence of mass shootings. It is hard to imagine how police might have a significant effect on stopping mass shootings, if there is no evidence armed civilians can stop mass shootings. Second, the corollary of that seems to be that countries which are more policed have fewer mass shootings. And that seems obviously false. In the USA, for example, around "

Clearly, in at least some cases, the police kills, rather than saves. Those are isolated incidents, but, as I believe I have shown, police preventing a crime is also an isolated incident. In order to justify having a police force, because the police force is costly, you would need to show with hard data that it saves significantly more people than it kills. I do not doubt the vast majority of police officers sincerely believe that. But that seems to be an assumption not based on hard data."

                  'And about death penalty, well, like I have said, it makes more sense than prisons, because prisons are places from which criminals return to society presumably more dangerous than they were when they entered it. Putting people who do petty crimes into prisons accomplishes the unwanted "learn from the best" effect, I do not think it is deniable. And murderers are, when in prison, almost always abused there, which leaves bad psychological consequences. Those bad psychological consequences, if anything, make murderers even more dangerous once they return from prison. It is hard to deny prisons make us less safe. Death penalty, unlike prisons, actually removes dangerous people from the society. However, I think putting our faith in it commits the same logical fallacy as when people think antivirus programs make us significantly safer. Any real algorithm for detecting computer viruses will have some false-positives, that is, detecting innocent programs as viruses (or other type of malware). This is even more true now than in the past, because now many programs (Internet browsers) include just-in-time compilers. Just-in-time compilers are an optimization of interpreters (necessary for executing JavaScript, the standard programming language of the Internet), which produces machine code directly understandable by CPU and executes it, which is faster than traditional interpreters. However, it is difficult to differentiate programs that do that from computer viruses, because computer viruses are malicious programs, usually directly understandable by CPU, which make copies of themselves. False positives of antivirus programs can have just as devastating consequences as malware. A few times, it has happened that system files from Windows Update get incorrectly recognized as malware, making countless computers useless. In May 2007, that was done by Symantec antivirus. In April 2010, this happened to McAfee, at the time of Windows XP SP3. In December 2010, it happened to AVG antivirus, when it detected system files of 64-bit Windows 7 as malware. As well, many security updates to SpiderMonkey, the JavaScript engine of the Firefox web browser, have been incorrectly flagged as viruses by antivirus software, making Firefox use outdated and less secure versions.

                  '. Antivirus programs may even end up harming the development of innocent programs more than it harms the development of malware, because malware developers tend to have a good idea of how antivirus programs work and have good intuitions what might trigger them, whereas developers of innocent programs tend not to know the details of how algorithms for detecting various types of malware work and can (just like I did when making the compiler for my programming language) unintentionally trigger them. People who trust antivirus programs massively underestimate the damage done by false positives and massively overestimate the protection they provide. Maybe it is because of what they were taught in school about computers, which is massively influenced by big corporations. Perhaps it is because of human psychology, as we tend to think bad things happen intentionally (that if a computer is malfunctioning, it is likely due to hacker attack), rather than being unintended consequences (that a computer is malfunctioning because of faulty antivirus software). For the same reason, death penalty can easily end up killing more people than it saves, even though that idea might sound crazy to its proponents. Of 100 murderers, only 1 or 2 are serial killers who will murder again. How do you reliably detect them? Because, if you kill a murderer who will not murder again, you have killed one person and saved nobody. Furthermore, any real justice system with death penalty will put at least some innocent people on death row. A widely cited statistic is that at least 4% of people on death row in the US are actually innocent. To put in another way, it is possible death penalty is killing more innocent people than it saves, not just people in general. I understand that, like the famous vegan activist Gary Yourofsky said multiple times, abolishing death penalty is an example of how flawed the idea of human rights is, because death penalty is certainly more humane than leaving people in prison for the rest of their lives. However, we cannot use one big government policy to justify the another. Prisons are a big government policy, they cannot be used to justify another big government policy that is death penalty. To summarize, while I think the idea of death penalty makes significantly more snese than the idea of prisons, nevertheless, I think it is based on fallacies of people drastically overestimating recidivism of murder and trusting the justice system way more than it can actually be trusted. I also like the quote by Ludwig von Mises that, as long as the constitution does not outlaw death penalty altogether, every single law and every single contract implicitly end with "...or else you might be put on the death row.". When I first heard that quote, back when I began studying politics, that quote seemed absurd to me. Now, when I realize just how absurd the justice system is, that quote seems like an uncomfortable but undeniable truth.'

The same goes for other supposed evidence of socialist (or, perhaps a better word, anti-capitalist or anti-voluntarist, as "socialism" strictly means "government ownership of means of production") policies working. Many international media reported when Croatia passed a law forcing the banks to forgive the debts of the poor citizens in 2015. What happened next to those banks? Well, some of them went bankrupt, and many poor people lost all their savings (the law guarantees us that, if a bank goes bankrupt, it needs to return the minimum of 100\'000 euros and the amount of money on our savings, but there is no guarantee when it will happen). The possibility that it\'s caused by that socialist policy is rarely mentioned, let alone discussed. So, of course, the historians will not write that. And that\'s how this distorted perspective on economic history is created. And this problem goes way back to the ancient times. It is a well-known thing the Roman Empire made life more hygienic.

                  '. One of the best quotes I heard about that is the quote by Mike Huemer that politicians today are in the position of the medieval physicians. Medieval physicians had pre-scientific ideas about how human bodies work and their treatments were usually worse than useless. Today, politicians have pre-scientific ideas about how the society works, and the best thing for them to do is to do nothing, no matter how disappointing that is. All until the 19th century, physicians thought bloodletting was a cure for many diseases. This even included anaemia. So, most of the time, it was worse than useless. How did the physicians convince themselves that bloodletting was useful? First of all, the "science" back then taught that most illnesses were caused by disbalance of bodily fluids, so it was instinctual to think bloodletting could help for many illnesses. Also, obviously, if the symptoms are caused by high blood pressure, bloodletting would appear to help. So, at the best of times, it relieved the symptoms, while making the underlying illness even worse (by stifling the distribution of oxygen by blood). Until the beginning of the 20th century, physicians thought a ketogenic (a low-carbohydrate low-protein diet) could cure type-2-diabetes. There is little doubt it made things worse, as low-carbohydrate diets lead to kidney problems in humans (and, contrary to popular belief, protein has little or no impact on that), and people with type-2-diabetes are even more vulnerable to that. As well, any real ketogenic diet is high in saturated fat which make type-2-diabetes worse and can even cause it in large amounts. But type-2-diabetes is often made worse by food allergies, which a severely restrictive diet coincidentally avoids (a low-protein diet, for example, does not contain milk or soy, the biggest sources of food allergies). As well, it is instinctual to think removing glucose and stuff that is easily converted to glucose (most amino-acids in protein) would help lower the glucose in blood. This was enough to convince the pre-scientific physicians that it helps. And the same is probably true for the modern-day government policies. Artificially lowering the interest rates seems like an excellent example of that. Low interest rates mean that it is less expensive to borrow money from banks, for some projects that may return that money back. But are high interest rates actually the problem? Or are they a signal something is wrong with the economy and that one should not start ambitious projects, as ambitious projects are likely to fail in the current economic situation? Quite a few economists think lowering interest rates, while they postpone economic depressions, they also make depressions worse. And the same goes for agricultural subsidies, but more on that later.'

                  'A common counter-argument, noted even by Michael Huemer himself, to that argument is that, given that we have at least some understanding of social sciences today, the government policies which try to base themselves on social sciences are at least slightly more likely to alleviate the symptoms than to make things worse. As appealing as this idea sounds, I think it is false. To understand why, consider the history of nutritional science. In the 1920s and 1930s, we understood that cholesterol leads to heart disease... but we thought cholesterol in our blood was the cholesterol we eat. The myth that the cholesterol in our blood is the cholesterol we eat is based on "common sense", as well as on the 1913 experiment on rabbits by Nikolay Anichkov which supposedly suggested that, but which nobody managed to replicate. As such, a common dietary advice was to replace eggs with butter. Today, we know this is a very wrong advice, as cholesterol in eggs we eat has little impact on the cholesterol in our blood, but saturated fat in butter have huge impact on it, as well as butter containing trans-saturated fat, which eggs do not. Now, you might say that replacing eggs with butter was not really following the science, as there were no studies suggesting exactly that replacing eggs with butter was good (studies to test that were hard to do back then, when measuring cholesterol was very expensive). Which is a good point, but it just illustrates how following even hard science (such as nutritional science) is hard. There have been studies strongly suggesting saturated fat leads to heart disease ever since the late 19th century, but it is easier to reason about a simplistic hypothesis (such as that the cholesterol in our blood is mostly the cholesterol we eat) than to immerse yourself in messy real-world data and make conclusions based on that real-world data. Then, in the 1950s, when it became clear the vast majority of cholesterol in our blood is produced by our liver, mostly in response to saturated fat in the diet, a common advice was to replace butter with margarine. As we now know, following that advice played little or no effect. What causes heart disease in butter is primarily the trans-saturated fat in it, rather than saturated fat in it (though, of course, they play some role). Trans-fat get absorbed in our blood and cause our immune system to misbehave and cause heart attacks. Margarine also contains trans-fat. The answer to the question whether margarine is better than butter is, as we now know, "It depends on which butter and which margarine.". Again, you might say there was never good evidence suggesting that replacing butter with margarine works, and it is obviously true. However, the history of nutritional science clearly illustrates just how easy it is to make yourself worse off by trying to follow the science. To be more likely to help than to hurt, you need to know a lot about the relevant science, and not just little. There are countless examples of how somebody might convince themselves they are following the science, while they are doing exactly the opposite of what the science suggests. It is, for example, a well-known thing that methionine is necessary for synthesis of literally all protein, because ribosomes cannot synthesize a protein the first amino-acid of which is not methionine (since the start codone on mRNA is also the codone for methonine). It is tempting to conclude that the form of protein found in sesame seeds, which is high in methionine, is therefore healthy. That is, it is tempting to conclude that until you know there is overwhelming evidence that the form of protein found in sesame seeds causes heart disease in humans. And if it is so easy to be misled by trying to follow nutritional science, how easy it must be to get misled by trying to follow social sciences, which are far more messy than nutritional science? And it is not just nutritional science, it is also even harder sciences. If somebody who knows only a little about how Internet works tries to diagnoze connectivity problems, they will probably try to do that using PING and/or TRACEROUTE. Quite often, this will lead to misdiagnozing the problem, because many networks these days reject all ICMP messages (that PING and TRACEROUTE use), and for a good reason (receiving a malformed ICMP massage will cause a poorly-configure server to crash, which is called "PING of Death"). But I would wager that most people who know how to use TRACEROUTE do not understand that it is often unreliable and why. And softer the science becomes, less useful "knowing a bit about it" becomes. Somebody who knows basic robotics might conclude that, since, for example, the Ziegler-Nichols method of tuning PID-controllers can be used to regulate a wide variety of systems regardless of how those systems function inside (it does not matter if they are electrical or mechanical), it is not important to know details about how the economy works in order to usefully regulate it. But that is an incredibly inappropriate analogy. First of all, the systems we are dealing with in basic robotics have nothing in themselves to regulate themselves. Economies, just like human bodies, have those things, and government actions are usually going against them. Also, in basic robotics, we know exactly what we want to achieve and how to measure how far we are from there. To usefully regulate the economy, we would need to precisely know things such as the velocity of money, which are difficult to even estimate. And, most likely, we would need to precisely know some other variables we do not yet know exist. Ancient physicians did not understand why sometimes bloodletting alleviates the symptoms and why it usually does not, because they had no concept of high blood pressure. Similarly with blood transfusion, Incas noticed that it sometimes cures the disease and used it regularly in spite of the fact (which should have been obvious) that it usually makes things worse, because they had no concept that different humans have different and usually incompatible types of blood. This leaves the question in the air, even if we take for granted Roosevelt\'s New Deal policies ended the Great Depression (and it is possible, given what we know, they made it worse)... does that actually mean similar policies would help us with modern-day economic depressions? I think that it does not mean that, for the same reason as blood transfusion once having cured some disease does not mean it will not make things worse next time, because of some factors Incas who practiced blood transfusion were unaware of (such as blood types). "Following the science" in politics should mean "There is overwhelming evidence this policy will be beneficial, as well as a widely-accepted scientific explanation for how it might. Therefore, we should implement that policy.". Unfortunately, what politicians usually mean when they say they follow the science is either "I was just mindlessly following orders." or "Here is a shotgun idea that seems somewhat plausible given some scientific theory, let\'s force everybody to participate in a poorly-designed and unethical experiment to test it.".'

Nearly no economist today agrees tariffs are a sensible policy or that rent ceilings are a sensible policy or that agricultural subsidies are a good policy (The evidence we have strongly suggests that, in the long run, agricultural subsidies, supposed to make food less expensive, actually make nearly all food more expensive by increasing the price of arable land. While not all economists agree with that, hardly any economist would agree that agricultural subsidies are a cost-effective policy. Even if they make food slightly less expensive, which is itself dubious, they undoubtedly increase the taxes, and almost no economist thinks they make food so much less expensive to be worth those taxes. Furthermore, even if they did decrease the price of subsidized food, that is not necessarily a good thing, because decreasing the price of milk and sugar will almost certainly drive the healthcare costs up.

When discussing eating meat, people often, in their arguments, replace meat industry as it really is with some vaguely imagined unicorn. They say stuff like \"<i>A grain-based diet that is veganism will lead to soil depletion.<\/i>\". Which is perhaps a legitimate concern (I have not studied enough agriculture to tell that), but meat industry that we have today clearly does not solve that problem. The vast majority of meat these days comes from factory-farmed grain-fed animals, obviously making that problem worse. Or the similar argument against vegetarianism \"<i>If we all adopted a primarily grain-based diet, we may even end up killing more animals, because machines that harvest crops tend to kill many rodents.</i>\". Implication, of course, being that the meat industry we have today is not responsible for deaths of countless rodents, which is obviously false. Similarly, when people argue for government intervention in the economy, they replace real-world governments with some vaguely imagined unicorns which actually follow the science, quite unlike real-world governments. It is very annoying to participate in such discussions, where arguments and empirical data about what could go wrong seem besides the point because the notion we are discussing is, well, ideal.<span id=\"social_sciences\" style=\"display:none;\"><br\/>And let's say, for the sake of argument, that we have a form of government that guarantees it's the social scientists who make political decisions, rather than people ignorant of social sciences. What makes you think things would go well? Do you think we can trust social sciences enough for that? I have some idea about social sciences, as I have published some papers about linguistics, about my <a href=\"toponyms.html\">alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia<\/a>. Based on what I have seen, I would say social sciences have very little to say about politics. Linguistics has little to say about whether it is politically a good move to claim Croatian and Serbian are a different language. It seems to me most linguists inside Croatia think it is, whereas most linguists outside of Croatia think it is not, but that neither of that is based on evidence. Most linguists think it is a good thing to try to preserve nearly-extinct languages, such as Istriot in Croatia. But that also does not appear to be based on evidence. What makes you think economics is different? In case there is some ambiguity, I am not saying social sciences are without merit. I am saying the parts of the social sciences that deal with political issues tend to be without much merit. Microeconomics, based on what I know, probably has much more merit than macroeconomics. Microeconomics can be studied empirically and is not related to politics. Macroeconomics is politicized and is very hard, if not impossible, to study empirically. Social scientists sometimes do worse than average people in predicting politics. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_of_the_collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union#Why_were_Sovietologists_wrong?\">almost no social scientist thought the Soviet Union would collapse<\/a>, but some (very few, but still a noticeable number) people who were not social scientists did. Social scientists really do not have a good track record when talking about politics. And that's recent history. Social sciences have not changed much since then. Of course, further back in history you go, the worse it gets. Most social scientists at the time, just like most people at the time, thought World War 1 would not be nearly as bloody as it turned out to be and believed that it would end all or nearly all wars. I generally don't agree with Greta Thunberg, but I like how she said that economists that they talk about fairy tales of eternal economic growth (economists are arguably far more optimistic about economy than other people), and when those fairy tales prove false, they fail to agree what caused a recession. Well, that is almost the opposite of science. I don't know how to make social sciences better. Many people say social sciences rely too much on statistics and too little on common sense. I do not agree with that. In fact, in my alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia, I did some statistical calculations which include the Shannon's entropy and collision entropy (which is rarely done in that part of linguistics). But we need to stop pretending that we have indisputable sciences which tell us what people should be forced to do. Because we do not. So, I don't think social sciences are scientific enough to justify taking away peoples' freedoms. Especially not those parts of social sciences that are usually cited to justify that.<br\/>" +
                'From my experience from social sciences, here are some things which can easily happen when you study them, which I assume do not happen nearly as often in natural sciences:<ol><li>You see some pattern in the data and you convince yourself it cannot be due to chance, even though you have no idea how to calculate it. And, indeed, for the pattern I have found in the Croatian toponyms, that first two consonants in river names tend to be <i>k</i> and <i>r</i>, respectively, you need to do birthday-paradox calculations, but where the number of people who share the same birthday is greater than two. There does not seem to be a way to solve that analytically, and not every social scientist knows programming enough to solve it numerically. That is not to say you will always be wrong in thinking something is unlikely to be due to chance, but, quite a few times, you will be.</li><li>A simplistic model convinces you some pattern you are seeing is unlikely, when it is not nearly as unlikely. This has happened to me at first. If you assume the language has 20 consonants which occur approximately equally often, the probability of the pattern I noticed occuring naturally is less than 1/10\'000. Similarly, the experiments I have made to test how well the algorithm I implemented in <a href="etymologist.html">Etymology Game<\/a> predicts phonological evolution of languages suggest it predicts around 16.7% better than chance. Namely, my algorithm correctly predicted the phonological evolution of a word from real-world data <a href="validation_results.html">0.56%</a> of the time, whereas a control algorithm predicted it correctly <a href="validation_of_control_algorithm.html">0.4797%</a> of the time. Does that mean that my algorithm does 0.56 / 0.4797 - 1 = 16.7% better than chance? Or are the results mostly an artifact of a simplistic control model, which quite often <i>predicts<\/i> the word would evolve into words which are probably unpronounceable in any language, such as <i>ghghad</i> and <i>krzkd</i>? It is hard to tell.</li><li>You are using a relatively complicated model, which makes intuitive but wrong assumptions. This has happened to me as well. If you use a model that tries to estimate the probabilities using the Shannon\'s entropy instead of the collision entropy (under an intuitive assumption that those two entropies will be approximately equal for human languages), it will tell you the probability of the pattern I noticed occurring by chance is around 1/500. Well, now I think, once I researched that more, that it is around 1/17 (5.9%). Realizing that required fixing a <a href="toponyms.html#correction">hard-to-find bug<\/a> in my program which I used to test my idea that Shannon\'s entropy of human languages would be approximately equal to the collision entropy. Similarly, as I explained in my <a href="Fonoloska_evolucija_jezika.docx">paper about Etymology Game</a>, on page 20, my model assumes languages respond to hard-to-pronounce consonant clusters at the end of a word by adding a paragoge vowel after the consonant cluster (for instance, that Proto-Indo-European word for the number seven, <i>*septm</i>, is likely to evolve into something like <i>*sepetme</i> or <i>*sepatma</i>), even though the real-world data suggests they generally respond by inserting an epenthetic vowel right before the last consonant in that cluster (like Latin <i>septem</i>). Thus my model gives precise (probabilities as numbers), complicated (it is programmed to do something, rather than nothing or behaving by chance, in such situations), but worse-than-chance predictions for how such words will evolve.</li><li>You get accused of talking gibberish because social scientists apparently cannot understand your mathematics. As has happened to me multiple times, like when I shared some of my ideas on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/n2hw22/entropija_dijelova_gramatike_hrvatskog_jezika/">Reddit<\/a>.</li><li>You deal with data which have been falsified for political or other purposes. Although this hasn\'t been my experience, it is arguably only because I was doing linguistics, which is less politicized than other social sciences. Social scientists often say they are able to tell apart gibberish from actual data. But it is clear that, at least sometimes, they cannot. For example, the Voynich Manuscript in linguistics. Is it a real language, or is it (at least mostly, as in being a steganography) meaningless? Linguists disagree on that, with some claiming they are able to assign probable meanings to certain words from it (or do statistical analyses suggesting it is a real language), and others arguing statistical analyses show it is not a real language (and showing a simple algorithm by which a medieval person could produce such a text).</li></ol>If something is hard to do properly, that means that, with few exceptions, it is not done properly. So, should we let that kind of science control our society? I do not know about you, but it does not seem like a good idea to me.<br />' +
                'Yet, it seems to me that this kind of science has a huge impact on our society. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a good example of that. Some studies that were used to justify lockdowns make the first mistake I mentioned, such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945e1.htm">Delaware study<\/a> (There is no attempt to calculate the p-value there. Nor is there a discussion why there was also a drop in mortality in the pre-lockdown Sweden at the same time, which, if you ask me, strongly suggests the drop in mortality in Delaware had much more to do with seasonality of COVID-19, the UV light from the Sun in summer killing the virus and Vitamin D deficiency being much lower in summer, than with the lockdowns.). Thankfully, such <i>studies<\/i> seem to be rare and not to have much impact on politics. But studies using computer models have had a lot of impact on policies. Studies predicting millions would die in the US or in Europe without lockdowns generally seem to make the second mistake, using simplistic computer models. Most such computer models made very simplistic assumptions both in terms of social sciences, and in terms of natural sciences. Namely, most such studies assume everybody who carries COVID-19 is equally likely to infect somebody else, whether or not they have symptoms. This assumption is obviously false, as one who coughs emits a lot more droplets with viruses into the air than one who just breathes. Scientists who wrote those studies presumably thought the errors would somehow cancel each other out, which, as later studies demostrated, they did not. In terms of social sciences, those studies assumed the behavior of people would not significantly change just because they know about the pandemic. As recent history has taught us, that assumption is also wildly wrong (Many restaurants bankrupted in pre-lockdown Sweden because people were afraid to go to restaurants. And the behavior of people did not significantly change after the end of lockdown and mask mandate in Texas.). To give you some perspective on just how wrong those early computer models were, the model that was used to justify lockdowns in the US predicted that <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/imperial-college-model-applied-to-sweden-yields-preposterous-results/">96\'000 people would die of COVID-19 by May 2020 in Sweden<\/a>. And, as of May 2021, there have been 14\'000 deaths with COVID-19 in Sweden (Whether or not <i>deaths with confirmed COVID-19</i> is a good proxy for <i>deaths from COVID-19</i> is a complicated question. The usual argument for using that as a proxy is that there are presumably many deaths from undiagnosed COVID-19, so that those two errors presumably cancel each other out. But that makes sense only at the beginning of the pandemic. Now that we have vaccines that, according to rigorous studies, reduce the chance of dying from COVID-19 to basically 0, but do not provide sterilizing immunity, as vaccines for many diseases unfortunately do not... How does it make any sense to assume deaths of people who are vaccinated but who happen to carry COVID-19 at the time of their deaths are mostly deaths from COVID-19? Is it possible, if not probable, that the Chilean Vaccination Paradox and Israeli Vaccination Paradox are statistical illusions created by assuming deaths with COVID-19 are a good proxy for deaths from COVID-19?). Predictions that lockdowns would save millions of people arguably fall into the third category. They make an intuitive assumption that, if you close most businesses, people would respond by staying at home. But recent history has taught us that is not what happens. When lockdowns were first implemented, many people were rushing into grocery stores buying unreasonable quantities of everyday products, making the stores more crowded. And there were massive protests that probably would not have happened if there were no lockdowns. Furthermore, deaths from traffic accidents turned out to paradoxically be more common in places with lockdowns than in places without them. Not remotely like the computer models assumed. It is hard to deny poorly-done social science played a major role in recent politics.<br/>' +
                "To be clear, I am not saying I know the Swedish model of dealing with a global pandemic is the best. I am not certain of that, because it is hard to research that. The anti-lockdown movement is just as full of faulty science making grotesquely wrong predictions. For example, in summer 2020, when COVID-19 rates were very low, an Oxford study led by Sunetra Gupta analyzed blood samples of some random people and concluded that around 70% of people have already survived COVID-19, mostly having no symptoms, and that we have probably reached herd immunity. That study made a bunch of unjustified assumptions, mostly in natural sciences (how to properly determine whether somebody has survived COVID-19 from a blood sample, that having survived COVID-19 provides a near-absolute immunity from it, that 70% of the population being immune is enough for herd immunity...), and, as we now know, made grotesquely wrong predictions. The reason COVID-19 was so low in summer was not herd immunity, but the UV light from the Sun destroying the virus, as well as people probably spending less time indoors during the summer. And, in the autumn 2020, even more people died from COVID-19 than in spring that year.<br/>" +
                "It is hard to figure out the truth about COVID-19. But the true nature of modern-day social sciences is very visible if you try to. Social sciences, as well as scientific fields that combine natural and social sciences, are making mathematically precise but grotesquely wrong predictions and, when it becomes obvious they are wrong, they whitewash those predictions. Not too different from conspiracy theorists. In fact, social sciences and fields that combine social and natural sciences may even be worse than conspiracy theories, in the sense that conspiracy theories do not tend to make precise predictions, but instead conspiracy theories tend to rely on ad-hoc explanations on why they cannot be confirmed. In social sciences and fields that combine social and natural sciences, the mathematics there and precision of the predictions give you false confidence they are correct. When it turns out those predictions are not correct, you get, at best, a post-hoc explanation, if not an outright attempt to whitewash those predictions (which, unfortunately, seems to be what is happening with obviously-false predictions about the COVID-19 pandemic). Social sciences and fields that combine social sciences with natural sciences are making falsifiable and possibly even scientific (though I am not so sure they tend to be scientifically reasonable, as they seem to make obviously-dubious assumptions about both social sciences and natural sciences in their calculations) predictions, but they do not act the way real science does when those predictions end up being obviously wrong. That is probably worse than most forms of pseudoscience, including conspiracy theories. And that undeniable fact is, I think, an excellent argument against technocracy.<br/>" +
                'If you believed the predictions of the simplistic computer models that hospitals would be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, the US policy of putting COVID-19 patients into nursing homes (that policy was suggested by <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2021/04/28/nyregion/cuomo-aides-nursing-home-deaths.html">Andrew Cuomo, who was later found to be involved in a scandal where the US government made it look like fewer people died from COVID-19</a>) is at least understandable, whether or not it is justifiable (I do not think it is ethical to intentionally kill grandmothers even if consequences for younger people were positive.). The policies of closing schools and not letting children visit their parents in prisons (as <a href="https://euobserver.com/opinion/148385">Croatia and Sweden have been doing</a>) are a lot more easy to justify if you believe the predictions of simplistic computer models that schools are the main way the pandemic spreads (children getting infected in schools and then infecting their parents and grandparents) than if you look at the incredibly messy real-world data (My understanding is that some studies from the Spanish Flu pandemic, back when epidemiology was in its infancy, suggested closing schools helps flatten the curve of the pandemic, but that no empirical studies done in this pandemic, now that studies are much more rigorous, suggest that.). If you look at the real-world empirical data, closing churches (where elderly people, who are much more likely to have symptoms and spread COVID-19, gather) probably makes more sense than closing schools, but almost no government has done that. If you believe shutting down most stores except the essential ones results in people staying home, as the simplistic computer models suggested, perhaps doing that is justified. But given that it results in mass panic of people rushing into grocery stores and buying unreasonable quantities of everyday products, leading to people being forced to buy in overcrowded stores and shortages of everyday products, it is hardly justifiable. Not to mention there have been quite a few dangers in the pandemic that computer models had no hope of predicting. In Texas, when the cooling system of the nuclear power plant stopped working, <a href="https://www.powermag.com/power-industry-pleads-for-priority-covid-19-testing-ppe-for-mission-essential-workers/">almost all the workers who were supposed to be there were infected with COVID-19</a>, and, if it were not for the modern automated safety systems (had they also failed), we would have probably had another Chernobyl. No matter how science-based as governments have recently tried to be, the society was not properly prepared for the dangers of the pandemic. It is instinctual to think the best way of dealing with an invisible enemy is to have a technocratic government trying to follow the science. But the evidence for that is thin at best.<br/>' +
                "As for the fifth type of problem in social sciences, of dealing with wrong data... Don't you think it is possible, if not probable, there were many Andrew Cuomos around the world, most of them not being detected? Clearly, it is possible to cover up half of the COVID-19 deaths in New York for months, so why it wouldn't be possible to do elsewhere for a much longer period of time? Excess mortality in Belarus, for example, is significantly higher than reported deaths with COVID-19, whereas it is the other way around in the vast majority of countries. And the data about China also seems very suspicious. I understand that there are many things that go in favor of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand that China had, unlike most other countries, organized food and grocery deliveries so that people there did not have to spend time in overcrowded stores to buy food and basic necessities. I understand that home ownership there is high, and different parts of families are mostly living in different houses, so that one person getting infected does not infect the whole family. I understand that the population there is young, and that the vast majority of people who die from COVID-19 are elderly. I understand China is not as plagued by heart disease and type-2-diabetes as most other countries are, the diseases which make COVID-19 deadly. But the government statistics showing less than 10'000 deaths are just unbelievable even when you take those things into the account, are not they?<br/>" +
                'Wouldn\'t a scientific way of dealing with a pandemic be to first try to explain the data we have, and only then implement policies based on those analyses? The countries most affected by the pandemic were the US and Eastern Europe. But why? I have (and everybody has) heard countless supposed explanations for COVID-19 mortality differing between countries, and, for every single one of them, just eye-balling the data makes it obvious it is not a true explanation. The most common supposed explanations are non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates and lockdowns. Well, first of all, it hardly makes sense to try to put all non-pharmaceutical interventions into a single variable, it can obviously be lumping good and bad policies together. It can obviously be that masks mandates are effective (How do people actually behave when forced to wear masks? Do they keep them clean enough to be effective? Do they even cover their nose with them so that they can be effective?), but that lockdowns are not, or vice versa (the same is true for many things in social sciences, such as the Economic Freedom Index advocated by the Austrian School of Economics, that it lumps good and bad policies together). Second, Scandinavian countries have done far fewer non-pharmaceutical interventions than either the US or most countries in Eastern Europe, yet they have fared much better. US had 11% excess mortality in 2020, Sweden had only 1.5% excess mortality, whereas Norway, Denmark and Finland had lower mortality in 2020 than in 2019. The difference in COVID-19 mortality between countries is caused by different life expectancies, countries with more elderly people will be hit more by the pandemic? Well, as appealing as this idea sounds, it is not supported by the data. Scandinavian countries have significantly higher life expectancy than the US or the Eastern Europe. And so does Japan, which also did not have many COVID-19 deaths, and neither did it have much non-pharmaceutical interventions (though more than Scandinavian countries). COVID-19 hits countries with highest heart disease and type-2-diabetes the most? Well, what about Sudan, the country plagued the most with heart disease and type-2-diabetes, but having almost no COVID-19? Clearly, that also plays a minor role, if it plays a role at all. Countries with highest vaccination rate have fewer deaths from COVID-19? Well, statistics (which I suppose are misleading, but, nevertheless...) show us otherwise. Countries which get more Sun (closer to the equator) have less COVID-19 because the UV light from the Sun kills the virus? Then how are Chile, Peru and Seychelles so plagued with COVID-19, in spite of being close to the equator? Island nations tend to have much less COVID-19? Again, what about Seychelles? If you cannot explain those things, what gives you the right to implement your policies? This may sound similar to when saturated fat deniers say stuff like "<i>Nutritional science cannot explain why Inuits and Maasai used to have low rates of heart disease until their diet got westernised.</i>", but it is really completely different. We do not know with reasonable certainty what Inuit diet was before it got westernised nor how commonly they used to get heart attacks, so the correct response is that those statements are probably myths, and should be dismissed in face of evidence we have from large studies. You cannot do the same thing here.<br/>' +
                'Citizens view governments as a good source of information on how to stay healthy. In reality, governments should be viewed as something that is perpetuating useless and sometimes even harmful myths about how to stay healthy. During the HIV outbreak, Reagan administration responded first by denying the mere existence of HIV (saying that "gay plague" has to be a joke), and then by recommending useless mask wearing and glove wearing, and recommending that restaurants do not serve homosexuals. Now that we know more about HIV, those responses seems beyond absurd. Mask wearing does nothing to stop HIV, and neither does social distancing, because HIV is not spread by droplets. While it is plausible that masks help against COVID-19, because it is mostly spread by droplets (although it also has some capacity for airborne spread, against which masks which are commonly worn can do nothing), there is not much evidence of that. The Center for Disease Control in the USA at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was recommending regularly disinfecting the surfaces, only to <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2021/04/08/health/coronavirus-hygiene-cleaning-surfaces.html">later admit disinfecting the surfaces is unlikely to have saved anybody from COVID-19</a>. Also, before the COVID-19 pandemic, Croatian government was recommending people not to eat outside to avoid getting infected by insects, and it was forbidden for restaurants to serve food on terraces. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants could, if anything, serve food on the terraces, so that the UV light from the Sun would destroy the viruses. You do not need to be an epidemiologist to understand that at least one of those advices then contradict epidemiology (presumably the older recommendations, since, as far as I know, no epidemiologist was consulted before making them, while many epidemiologists from many countries seem to agree on the newer ones). And sometimes governments appear to be outright lying about public health issues. For instance, the government of Neatherlands is telling young people <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2021/07/18/partygoers-suffering-long-covid-dancing-janssen-can-sue-govt-urgenda">it is safe to dance in a nightclub immediately after being vaccinated with Johnson&amp;Johnson (Janssen) vaccine</a>. That is not true, COVID-19 vaccines only start working some 2-4 weeks after the vaccination (and even then, it is hardly responsible, because vaccinated people can and do transmit the virus, and vaccines do not reduce the chance of elderly people dying from COVID-19 quite to zero, for example, a vaccinated 75-year-old is about as safe from COVID-19 as an unvaccinated 50-year-old is). I understand the problem the government of Neatherlands is trying to solve, that they are trying to motivate young people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and counter the anti-vaccination movement popular in Europe. But attempting to counter anti-vaccination movement with misinformation to make people think vaccines are more effective than they actually are is arguably unethical and can easily backfire.<\/span>';

In socialism, people are not greedy for money, but for political power. When some of them succeed, they end up hurting the society with bad policies. Socialism probably makes people even more greedy than capitalism does because it gives them a sense of entitlement, that they are worthy of some goods no matter what they achieve.

                  'It is often stated that regulations are necessary to make people safe in capitalism, since the big business does not care enough about the safety of the workers and customers. But, to paraphrase Milton Friedman, safety regulations are philosophically very unsound, because they are essentially putting a price on human life. Most people think it would be a bad thing to pass a law that forces car manufacturers to make rear airbags, because that would make cars significantly more expensive. But the obvious truth is, requiring cars to have ABS brakes also makes them more expensive. So where do you draw the line? The fact is, wherever you put the line, you are essentially saying human life has some price. Not to mention safety regulations might lull engineers into false sense of security, making them think it is enough to obey some essentially-arbitrary safety regulations. Regulations requiring animal testing of medicine have a history of both giving us false sense of security and false sense of danger. In the Cutter Vaccine Incident of 1955, a vaccine against polio was judged to be safe by being tested on monkeys, when it turned out to have horrible side effects in humans, because of which the vaccination program had to be aborted, and a massive distrust of vaccines started. The government, instead of responding by saying to themselves "Well, maybe animal testing is not a good principle." and stop requiring it, decided to add countless more regulations on top of the existing ones. On the other hand, it was once common knowledge Aspirin was dangerous for people with heart disease because it incresed the risk of heart attack in some animals. As it later turned out, it protects against heart attacks in humans. And it is probably impossible to estimate how many lives are lost due to life-saving medicine not getting on the market because it has bad side-effects in some animals, even though it would not have those side effects in humans. Proponents of government-mandated animal testing insist it is very unlikely penicillin would be banned if it was found today just because it is lethal to hamsters, because the experts can judge which data from animal testing is relevant and which data is not. How can we know that? And, even if that is true, how can we know the decisions are actually made by competent people? Given how much animal suffering government-mandated animal testing causes, and that it obviously delays life-saving treatment (as medicine still needs to be tested on humans), answers to those questions deserve a lot of scrutiny, and they seem not to get that scrutiny. Milton Friedman, when he said that thing about regulations being philosophically unsound, referred to the case of Ford Pinto. Engineers at Ford thought they came up with a brilliant way to make cars less expensive to produce. What the testing they had at the time did not reveal (and modern testing almost certainly would) is that the change they made to the fuel tank makes the car much more likely to catch fire in case of a rear crash. Many people were burnt alive because of that mistake. And the government responded to it by adding a ton of regulations about manufacturing of cars. An obvious question is what made the government think those regulations would have any positive effect. Did they think lawmakers knew better than engineers? Engineers have already learned the fact that what the engineers of Ford Pinto were doing to fuel tanks should not be done, and they learned it the very hard way. Expecting that thing to happen again just because there are no laws prohibiting that seems foolish and absurd when you think about that. Whenever some catastrophy happens because a private company has made an error, the government steps in with more and more laws claiming those laws will help. But there is usually little evidence those laws would have prevented that catastrophy from happening, and no evidence that those laws will have a significant positive effect in the future.'

And if you put the laws about work conditions from a rich country such as the USA into Bangladesh, you would make almost every job in Bangladesh illegal. Clearly, they are not applicable there, so they are not human rights. And, yes, obviously, sometimes social and economic freedoms do indeed infringe upon human rights. But governments are almost always unwilling and probably unable to do anything about those things. Circumcising a non-consenting boy because your religion tells you to do so is arguably a violation of human rights. But almost no government does anything about that (and maybe doing something about that would do more harm than good). Perhaps people being free to eat meat infringes upon animal rights. But governments do little-to-nothing about that. And maybe that is even a good thing, because, as we have seen, bats being illegal to eat in China does not stop people from eating them. To the contrary, it makes bats which are eaten receive no veterinary care, leading to pandemics.

But, the truth is, one does not need to believe in the Austrian School of Economics to think government intervention in the economy is almost always a bad thing. Personally, I think Austrian School of Economics is pseudoscience. Austrian School of Economics, for example, says that people are not exploited on their jobs, because people are there voluntarily and can leave whenever they want. Well, clearly, sometimes, even in free societies, people are not voluntary on their jobs, in the sense that they cannot leave whenever they want. If you are a doctor or a firefighter, leaving your job because you are displeased with the conditions there can very well have terrible consequences not just for you, but also for people around you. And saying voluntary interactions between rational individuals always leads to good outcomes appears to contradict the basic game theory. I mean, is not a corollary of that, that the greedy algorithms would always produce just as good outcomes as algorithms that employ dynamic programming? The Austrian School of Economics explains away the failure of socialist regimes using what it calls the "Economic Calculation Problem". Economic Calculation Problem essentially claims that the complex problem of economic calculation with the incomplete data can be solved much more quickly and accurately if the system solving it is distributed (capitalism) rather than centralized (socialism). I think a good response to the Economic Calculation Problem is that it is not really corroborated by computer science. In computer science, there is a thing called The Problem of Hidden Terminal, which can be said to be the opposite of the Economic Calculation Problem. The Problem of Hidden Terminal occurs only in wireless decentralized networks, and it is a crucial problem in them that makes large decentralized wireless networks impossible. It is when computers in a network can more-or-less accurately estimate the amount of data that is currently being transmitted through the network, but they drastically underestimate the number of computers in the network (as they are behind some barrier or simply too far away for the signal from them to get to the computer), leading to computers refusing to do anything because they are mistakenly thinking the network is overloaded. Decentralizing the information about the state of the wireless network does not make it work better, it makes it work significantly worse, if at all. However, as far as I can see, you cannot make such a counter-argument to the Michael Huemer\'s argument for libertarianism, that governments are in the position of ancient physicians. Governments are not in the position of programmers. Programmers have at least basic understanding of how computers work internally, and computers actually follow the algorithms specified in the programs. We do not know remotely enough about social psychology to predict how people will behave in some new situations, and how the society as a whole will behave is even more of a mystery. So, I would discourage my fellow libertarians from using the Austrian Economics in arguments, as those arguments are unlikely to be convincing to educated people. However, that does not mean there are no excellent arguments against government intervention in the economy.'

The ethernet networks, for example, bypass the need for a centralized server telling which computer is allowed to send its message at which time simply by, in case the network is overloaded, the computer having a message to send waits for a randomly chosen amount of time. And it is important that the amount of time to wait is actually randomly chosen because two computers accidentally chosing the same amount of time would lead to types of errors called livelocks. However, computers behaving unpredictably, just like humans would, paradoxically, avoids that problem. The need for a centrlized server with a clock to synchronize clocks of devices in WiFi networks is being avoided simply by each packet of information in WiFi starting with five alternating ones and zeros, which are used for synchronizing the receiver and the emitter.

Croatian media are full of stories of there being an imminent danger of the Bosnian Muslims or the Serbian nationalists attacking us, and that we need to invest more in the military. Are those stories credible? Look, I am Croatian, and I have no bright idea. I could think of some arguments why those stories might not be credible. First, they are sensationalist, so they are easily sold to the media. Second, there is a political incentive to make people believe those things, to justify the high taxes that make our country bankrupt, and to justify taking money from the funds of the European Union (that could probably be spent way better). And even if those stories are true, if there indeed are people who will conquer Croatia, how to actually decrease the number of victims? Will the attempt to fight decrease the number of victims? Or, maybe, just maybe, will it actually increase it? Sure, some military operations of the Croatian War of Independence, such as Bljesak (Flash) and Oluja (Storm), are widely agreed to have been one of the best-organized military operations in modern history. But such things are relatively rare. We need to also consider things that the Croatian military did wrong. Governments protecting us in case of a foreign invasion can only work if the military commanders are sane and competent people. Sometimes they are not sane. Slobodan Praljak, for instance, killed many people just because they were of different religion and later killed himself. Sometimes they appear to be incompetent, and to lull people into false sense of security. Perhaps the best example of military lulling people into false sense of security is Vukovar Massacre. Basically, a Serbian named \u0416\u0435\u0459\u043A\u043E \u0420\u0430\u0436\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0438\u045B organized an illegal army to attack a hospital at Vukovar, because it was supposedly filled with people fighting for the independence of Croatia (and therefore deserve to die). The Croatian military was present in the city, and people were certain they were safe from that illegal army. The suggestions about evacuating the hospital were scorned at. However, when the Croatian military leader present in the city, Mile Dedakovi\u0107, warned of the imminent danger, and the president Franjo Tu\u0111man promised to send him weapons (it is a bit <a href=\"https://www.24sata.hr/news/mile-dedakovic-trazio-pomoc-ali-tumana-nisu-htjeli-buditi-243737\">controversial<\/a> whether he even promised to send him weapons)... those weapons mysteriously disappeared. Needless to say, the illegal army killed many people, and the Croatian military ended up doing nothing but having lulled people into false sense of security. This reads like a poorly-written horror story full of plot holes. But you know as they say, reality is weirder than fiction because fiction at least needs to make sense to the author. Events during the war do not need to make sense to anybody, and the plans made by the government to keep its citizens safe in the case of foreign invasion often turn out to be gibberish. BBC news at the time even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2988304.stm\">suggested</a> the Croatian government let Vukovar Massacre happen on purpose. I do not believe that, but I cannot deny the Croatian government handled it worse than if they did nothing. Most people in Croatia agree that having weapons is not a right, but a privilege to be earned. Yet, somehow, most of them agree the Croatian government somehow deserves to have weapons. Well, I fail to see why. And I think all governments are like that. Sure, not all governments are equal. Varivode Massacre, committed by the Croatian government, is nothing compared to the Srebrenica Massacre, committed by the Serbian government. But which government that has existed for more than a few decades doesn't have dark history? Then, why would governments deserve to have weapons? So, if I, as somebody who lives in Croatia, don't know those things, how could some American politician know?</span>";

I can see how people can think death penalty or gun control actually do good (at least until you look into what the gun control laws actually say, as most gun control proposals ban automated weapons, those that may actually come useful in self-defense when every second counts, while leaving the weapons that are actually used in mass shootings legal), but, let's face it, the evidence doesn't support that either. It feels good to legislate laws against abortion. But does it do good? Well, there are probably a few women who might change their minds because of those laws. But the vast majority of women who would otherwise do abortion legally would end up doing abortion illegally, risking their own life by that. It feels good to legislate minimum wage laws, thinking you are increasing the pleasure of the exploited. However, does it do good? Sure, a few workers, who had a wage slightly lower than the new minimum wage, will get a pay raise. But those that actually had very low wages, significantly lower than the new minimum wage, will end up losing their jobs because of the minimum wage, and so too will many people who would otherwise get an entry-level job lose that opportunity."

                  "Incidentally, this pattern of government policies possibly helping an average person, but obviously hurting those who need help the most, extends way beyond the minimum wage laws. Schools often emphasize building self-esteem in children. While studies show it helps an average person, they also show it hurts those who need help the most. One cannot talk himself into mental health, and pretending that it can be done hurts those who need help the most. Or the child labor laws. Sure, laws against child labor might help a child whose parents are brainwashed into opposing education. But it will hurt those desperately poor families to which child labor makes a significant portion of income. Sometimes child labor is the only way for a family not to starve. Or the net neutrality laws. Sure, they probably help an average Internet user. But they put a burden on last-mile ISPs, and the people in remote villages who have no Internet access are hurt the most by the net neutrality laws. Similarly with laws regarding the quality of electricity. Laws demanding high-quality electricity might help people with complicated electronics that can indeed be damaged by brownouts or strong higher harmonics. But what about people who don't have any electricity in their houses and who just want to use electricity for light? Arguably, they are being hurt by those laws. Or the policies regarding the conservation of languages. We can discuss whether it is a good thing to have multiple languages in a society (personally, I do not think it is, as a lot of resources are spent on language learning and translation, not to mention multiple languages make it easier to implement censorship), but those policies undoubtedly burden the low-income people, as it is usually the low-income people who happen to know the nearly-extinct languages. In all those cases, while it is possible that government policies help an average person, they hurt precisely those who need help the most. Also, many countries these days have a more-or-less flat tax rate, but have free higher education. It is hard to deny this is basically taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich. People who have higher education tend to be significantly richer than people who do not, whatever be the reason. And making higher education free makes that inequality even larger, as well as increasing the taxes. As well, the stated purpose of the Andrew Cuomo's policy of putting elderly COVID-19 patients into nursing homes instead of to hospitals was to protect the young people from hospitals getting overwhelmed, at the expense of the elderly people. I see no reason to think it saved anybody, but it obviously hurt those who need help the most."

                  "And about education... To put it brutally, schools are places where children are forced to learn to analyze poetry, to speak Latin, and that Jasenovac is anti-Croatian propaganda (that less than 100'000 people died there, although even the statistics of the Paveli\u0107'es regime itself tell us around 150'000 people were killed in that concentration camp, and there are good reasons to think it was significantly more). Analyzing poetry and speaking Latin is useless at best, and I doubt it helps critical thinking. And the history (more like propaganda) children are taught at school is undoubtedly damaging to critical thinking. Most people reject anarchism because they think \"Well, it is better to risk having a Holocaust once in a century than to risk having tribal warfare every day.\", not realizing Holocaust was not the only major atrocity that happened in the 20th century, or even the biggest one (Stalin and Churchill both killed more people than Hitler did, I do not think any serious historian would deny that), just because other atrocities committed by various governments are not even mentioned in history textbooks. The history that is taught in school prevents people from realizing just how inhumane governments can be, and that is why most people reject anarchism. It is easy to convince people to fight a hypothetical-at-best danger that is tribal warfare when they do not see the real danger that are genocidal or vastly incompetent governments. And, like I have said in my Pseudosciences page linked to the left, science that is taught at school can easily be worse than useless. Little knowledge can easily be worse than no knowledge. Teaching children that methionine is the most important amino-acid without which no protein can be synthesized, but not teaching them that methionine appears to somehow cause heart disease in humans even in amounts it is usually ingested these days, that is misleading children into damaging their health. Also, the history of science that is taught at school makes children susceptible to survivorship bias, as schools only teach success stories and almost no failure stories. Nearly everybody wants people to have more education, primarily because there are many studies showing people with higher education earn significantly more. But like Bryan Caplan, and countless people before him, put it, there could hardly be a more misleading statistics. People who go to college are the people who did better in high-school, they tend to be more diligent and intelligent. If you put them in prison for a few years, rather than in college, chances are, they would still end up earning more than people who did poorly in high-school. And even if colleges do help people earn more money (which is by no means self-evident), how do we know that is because of the knowledge and skills gained at college, rather than because of virtue signaling that the diploma enables? Of course, it depends on the particular job we are talking about, and it is hard to determine. But if it is due to virtue signaling rather than knowledge and skills, a push for more education is analogous to forcing everybody at a sport event to stand up rather than sit down, so that they could supposedly see better. Just because if one person stands up, they sees better, it does not follow that if everybody stands up, they will see better, in fact, the opposite is true. Whether or not we should pursue more education is an incredibly complicated topic, and most people do not realize that. Whether or not the government should subsidize higher education is even more complicated, and it is obvious to me countless things could go wrong with that."

        I hope the way I communicated the libertarian ideas made you think. I
        realize that they are hard to accomplish, because many people like the
        false sense of security and justice the laws give them. But the first
        step towards achieving some political goal is to speak out about it.<br />It's
        difficult to convince people to value freedom. It's much easier to
        convince them that giving up liberty somehow makes a society better.
        It's instinctual to think that taking away peoples' freedom and
        controlling what they do somehow makes them more economically efficient.
        That's why we had the things such as slavery, fascism and communism. And
        violent revolutions are, exactly because of that, counter-productive. If
        the vast majority of people believe government is necessary for safety,
        overthrowing a government usually leads to an even more oppressive
        government forming. Even when you do convince people to value freedom,
        there is often a state holding them back. For instance, the government
        was one who was putting the liberators of the slaves into prisons.<br />
        Achieving libertarianism would require a giant paradigm shift in the way
        most people think about politics. People usually consider sovereignity
        of countries to be a good thing. Libertarians do not, we hate the idea
        that some fallible government should have absolute power. People usually
        consider equality before the law to be a good thing, except, in recent
        times, for vaccination companies. People have started to realize holding
        vaccination companies liable for incredibly rare (if real) severe
        side-effects of vaccination discourages investment in this essential
        business and does more harm than good. Hopefully people will soon
        realize the same is true not just for vaccination. Most people consider
        rule of law to be a good thing. But rule of law only makes sense if laws
        are good, and libertarians think the vast majority of laws we have are
        bad, and that it is a good thing they are not always enforced. Most
        people think corruption is always bad, that it is never a good thing if
        the government breaks its own laws. Libertarians think corruption is a
        symptom of a bigger problem of stupid senseless laws, and that
        eliminating the corruption while doing nothing about the underlying
        problem often does more harm than good.<br />
        People tend to think it is important who is on power, and that, if they
        were on power, things would probably be better. For example, people tend
        to describe Dalai Lama and Mao as mass murderers. In reality, if you
        were in their shoes, you would probably have done the same, afraid for
        your life and realizing how powerless you actually are. Imagine that you
        are Dalai Lama receiving a letter saying &quot;<i
          >We are about to do some ritual, and, for that ritual, we need
          this-many cut-off hands and this-many cut-off heads. Order your army
          to kill or mutilate some Chinese people to deliver that to us... or
          else we will kill you and replace you with somebody else.</i
        >&quot;. What would you have done? What would you have done if you were
        in Mao's shoes when he went to investigate reports of mass starvation in
        Henan, and people there replanted rice from multiple acres into one to
        make it look like the crops had not have failed? People who appear to be
        on power are usually powerless to change anything, and are often also
        unaware of what is really going on (or at least the extent of the
        problem). If the country you are governing had been struck by famine for
        decades, and there comes a biologist called Lysenko claiming to have a
        solution, and many (though not most of them) biologists agreed with him,
        there is a very good chance you would implement their policies much like
        Stalin and Mao did. When their country was plagued by the COVID-19
        pandemic, an illness with, at that time, no known cure or prevention,
        which appeared to mostly be spread by asymptomatic individuals while
        being very deadly to elderly people and other people with low immunity,
        and there was a group of scientists claiming that lockdowns and mask
        mandates could curb the pandemic, the vast majority of governments
        implemented policies similar to those that those scientists were
        suggesting. Obviously, those policies did not turn out to be nearly as
        harmful as Lysenkoism turned out to be, but they are similarly
        poorly-designed experiments (we still do not know beyond reasonable
        doubt whether they work) everybody was forced to participate in. Really
        makes you wonder how are most people today, including most politicians,
        really different from Stalin and Mao, does not it? Are modern
        politicians simply in different situations, rather than being
        significantly more competent and well-intentioned? Clearly, if their
        country is in some situation which seems hopeless, and there comes a
        group of scientists claiming without good evidence to have a solution,
        modern politicians are willing to force everybody to participate in a
        poorly-designed experiment to test whether that solution works. The
        Croatian ex-prime-minister Ivo Sanader has been serving a sentence in
        Remetinec jail since 2012 for the abuse of power, and most people think
        that happened only because we chose the wrong party at the election and
        that him ending up in jail is justice. In reality, justice would be if
        the society is structured so that such things cannot happen, and
        somebody else would have probably done the same if they were in their
        shoes. Restricting the government so it can do no harm is way more
        important than enabling it to do something good by forcing people to do
        things against their will. Such a paradigm shift in thinking, that
        people stop worrying about who is on power, and start worrying about
        what incentives people on power actually have, is hard to accomplish.

          >What happened to me so that I became a libertarian? Well, I realized
          that the government-backed-up pseudosciences destroyed my childhood
          and teenage years. After my parents got bitterly divorced, somebody
          from the social security (and I am quite sure I know exactly who, but
          I won't name them here) made up a story that my father was a rapist
          and that I was a witness. Since they were in the government, many
          people believed them back then, including my mother. Both my parents
          lost their jobs and gave all the money I was supposed to start my life
          with to lawyers. That story was well-known, and nobody wanted to be a
          friend with me. I was lonely (thankfully, I am an only child, so I
          didn't have to share this little money my parents were able to spend
          on me with my siblings), and I became a part of a group of vandals and
          alcoholics. Additionally, my mother ended up in jail for a year.
          Government might steal money from my fellow citizens and give it to me
          in compensation, but it cannot give me my childhood and teenage years
          back. Even today, I sometimes get asked whether there is some truth to
          that story about my father. Uncomfortable, I answer that there isn't,
          but that that story, because the government got involved, had very
          real and devastating consequences. I am no longer an alcoholic and a
          vandal, and I am relatively respected among the people who know me.
          But to prevent other people from getting into such situations, I want
          to send a message: "Don't ascribe superpowers to the people in your
          government." That means don't believe ridiculous conspiracy theories,
          but also don't believe that the government can do miracles to protect
          us.</i

        Latin I posted there:
        <div lang="la" class="quotation">
          Quid cogitatis de anarchismo? Ego anarchista sum, ego cogito melius
          esse, si imperia et leges non essent. Ego non video, quomodo possint
          bonae leges existere? Quomodo possint leges imperiaque societatem
          protegere? Consideretis: Nemo, qui non insanus est, vult aliquem
          occidere. Et militia venit solummodo postquam insanus homo occidat
          aliquem. Et tunc militia sinit eum insanum hominem in carcerem. Carcer
          non est (et probabiliter non potest esse) locus ubi is insanus homo
          sanus futurus est, carcer locus est ubi is plus insanus factus erit.
          Ergo, is insanus homo, qui suae insanitatis causa aliquem occidit,
          insanior revertetur in societatem.<br />
          Securitas, quae nobis data a militia est, falsa est. In saeculis
          historiae, etsi custodes et equites omnes spectabant et custodiebant,
          non poteras, viis in urbibus iens, securus a latronibus esse.<br />
          Et de rebus oeconomicis... Linguae videntur esse sine imperiis posse.
          Si linguae sine imperiis possunt esse, cur oeconomia non possit?<br />
          Et de rebus bellorum... Paene omnia bella horum temporum pugnae sunt,
          ut omnia bella cessent. Sed bella numquam bella inhibere succedent. Et
          tela solummodo raris temporibus veniunt ubi debentur, arma bonorum
          hominum saepe veniunt in malas manus.<br />
          Civitates amant falsam securitatem, quod leges et imperia dant eis.
          Difficile pugnare contra ei est. Multi homines censent libertatem
          civitates oeconomice parum strenuas facere, et quod libertas, quodam
          modo, facit homines res, quae non rationales sunt, facere. Id est cur
          habebamus Fascismum, Communismum et servos. Sed possumus sperare
          numerum eorum hominum, qui libertatem non amant, minorem in futuro
          esse.
