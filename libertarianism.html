        <br />There are statistics that show that governments (mainly socialism
        and communism) have, in recent times, killed many more people than
        murderers, or even wars, did. It's a phenomenon called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide">democide</a>.<br />
        <br />Some famous people that call themselves libertarians are the
        linguist Noam Chomsky and the Nobel-prize winning economist Milton
        Friedman.<br />
        <br />Somalia is often alleged to be evidence of the lack of a
        government causing violence. However, in 2004, after being stateless for
        more than a decade, its murder rate was less than half of the Africa's
        average murder rate.<br />

        The word "libertarianism" is defined as "a belief in human free will".
        Now, the phrase "belief in" has two quite distinct meanings: one is the
        belief that something exists, and the other one is the belief that
        something is reliable.

        In politics, it's mainly used in the second sense. Its basic principle
        (called non-aggression-principle) is that initiation of force is always
        immoral. The same applies to the things where other people believe that
        it's justified, like the police.<br />
        Libertarianism has a bad name. Its adherents are often said to be
        selfish and greedy. But the same is true for many other political
        opinions that aren't popular. That's because its arguments aren't
        communicated in a good way (they're often accompanied by things such as
        global warming denial), or worse, they aren't being communicated at all.

First, people back then had religions that commanded them to murder the infidels (<i>id est<\/i>, the people of other tribes) or do human sacrifices. Today, we don't have that. If we did, the government wouldn't be able to stop that violence. It isn't able to stop even the Islamic terrorists, yet alone transform the entire society of religious lunatics into reasonable and peaceful people. Second, today we have capitalism. If you have at least some money, it's usually much cheaper to buy something you need than to kill for that. It also usually makes it much cheaper to hire someone to work for you than to have slaves.

But, like I think I have shown, recidivism is not something to worry about when it comes to murder and, even if it were, prisons are not a solution. Also, how is it justice if there is basically 50/50 chance of getting away with murder? Justice is if willful actions have predictable consequences. Also, to quote Ayn Rand, we are living in a society where nobody knows first-hand what is legal and what is not. We have so many laws and they are so complicated that nobody can fully understand them. For laws to be just, an average person needs to be able to understand them. Not to mention there is also a huge gap between what people think the law says and what it actually says. Copyright laws being the most obvious example. Most people think that, if there is no copyright licence on something, that means it is not copyrighted. In reality, a piece of software without a licence is implicitly "all rights reserved".

In other words, it is possible for a police officer who injures a shooter to prevent a certain mass shooting to get in jail because of that. The question is, of course, whether the presence of the police decreases the chance of a mass shooting occurring. Admittedly, I do not have hard data about that, but I expect the answer to be no. First of all, the corollary of that is civilians having weapons would also decrese the incidence of mass shootings, presumably even more so. Such a claim is considered insane by most Croatians. The public in the USA is obviously divided about that issue, but social scientists do not seem to be. The positions social scientists take seem to range between gun control (restricting civilian access to firearms) having no effect (that is the view I subscribe to, as it seems like a reasonable null-hypothesis when there is no good data) on mass shootings to it having a significant positive effect, significantly decreasing the incidence of mass shootings. It is hard to imagine how police might have a significant effect on stopping mass shootings, if there is no evidence armed civilians can stop mass shootings. Second, the corollary of that seems to be that countries which are more policed have fewer mass shootings. And that seems obviously false. In the USA, for example, around "

Clearly, in at least some cases, the police kills, rather than saves. Those are isolated incidents, but, as I believe I have shown, police preventing a crime is also an isolated incident. In order to justify having a police force, because the police force is costly, you would need to show with hard data that it saves significantly more people than it kills. I do not doubt the vast majority of police officers sincerely believe that. But that seems to be an assumption not based on hard data."

Many international media reported when Croatia passed a law forcing the banks to forgive the debts of the poor citizens in 2015. What happened next to those banks? Well, some of them went bankrupt, and many poor people lost all their savings (the law guarantees us that, if a bank goes bankrupt, it needs to return the minimum of 100\'000 euros and the amount of money on our savings, but there is no guarantee when it will happen). The possibility that it\'s caused by that socialist policy is rarely mentioned, let alone discussed. So, of course, the historians will not write that.

Medieval physicians had pre-scientific ideas about how human bodies work and their treatments were usually worse than useless. Today, politicians have pre-scientific ideas about how the society works, and the best thing for them to do is to do nothing, no matter how disappointing that is. All until the 19th century, physicians thought bloodletting was a cure for many diseases. This even included anaemia. So, most of the time, it was worse than useless. How did the physicians convince themselves that bloodletting was useful? First of all, the "science" back then taught that most illnesses were caused by disbalance of bodily fluids, so it was instinctual to think bloodletting could help for many illnesses. Also, obviously, if the symptoms are caused by high blood pressure, bloodletting would appear to help. So, at the best of times, it relieved the symptoms, while making the underlying illness even worse (by stifling the distribution of oxygen by blood). Until the beginning of the 20th century, physicians thought a ketogenic (a low-carbohydrate low-protein diet) could cure type-2-diabetes. There is little doubt it made things worse, as low-carbohydrate diets lead to kidney problems in humans (and, contrary to popular belief, protein has little or no impact on that), and people with type-2-diabetes are even more vulnerable to that. As well, any real ketogenic diet is high in saturated fat which make type-2-diabetes worse and can even cause it in large amounts. But type-2-diabetes is often made worse by food allergies, which a severely restrictive diet coincidentally avoids (a low-protein diet, for example, does not contain milk or soy, the biggest sources of food allergies). As well, it is instinctual to think removing glucose and stuff that is easily converted to glucose (most amino-acids in protein) would help lower the glucose in blood. This was enough to convince the pre-scientific physicians that it helps. And the same is probably true for the modern-day government policies. Artificially lowering the interest rates seems like a good example of that. Low interest rates mean that it is less expensive to borrow money from banks, for some projects that may return that money back. But are high interest rates actually the problem? Or are they a signal something is wrong with the economy and that one should not start ambitious projects, as ambitious projects are likely to fail in the current economic situation? Quite a few economists think lowering interest rates, while they postpone economic depressions, they also make depressions worse.'

What makes you think things would go well? Do you think we can trust social sciences enough for that? I have some idea about social sciences, as I have published some papers about linguistics, about my <a href=\"toponyms.html\">alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia<\/a>. Based on what I have seen, I would say social sciences have very little to say about politics. Linguistics has little to say about whether it is politically a good move to claim Croatian and Serbian are a different language. It seems to me most linguists inside Croatia think it is, whereas most linguists outside of Croatia think it is not, but that neither of that is based on evidence. Most linguists think it is a good thing to try to preserve nearly-extinct languages, such as Istriot in Croatia. But that also does not appear to be based on evidence. What makes you think economics is different? In case there is some ambiguity, I am not saying social sciences are without merit. I am saying the parts of the social sciences that deal with political issues tend to be without much merit. Microeconomics, based on what I know, probably has much more merit than macroeconomics. Microeconomics can be studied empirically and is not related to politics. Macroeconomics is politicized and is very hard, if not impossible, to study empirically. Social scientists sometimes do worse than average people in predicting politics. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_of_the_collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union#Why_were_Sovietologists_wrong?\">almost no social scientist thought the Soviet Union would collapse<\/a>, but some (very few, but still a noticeable number) people who were not social scientists did. Social scientists really do not have a good track record when talking about politics. And that's recent history. Social sciences have not changed much since then. Of course, further back in history you go, the worse it gets. Most social scientists at the time, just like most people at the time, thought World War 1 would not be nearly as bloody as it turned out to be and believed that it would end all or nearly all wars. I generally don't agree with Greta Thunberg, but I like how she said that economists that they talk about fairy tales of eternal economic growth (economists are arguably far more optimistic about economy than other people), and when those fairy tales prove false, they fail to agree what caused a recession. Well, that is almost the opposite of science. I don't know how to make social sciences better. Many people say social sciences rely too much on statistics and too little on common sense. I do not agree with that. In fact, in my alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia, I did some statistical calculations which include the Shannon's entropy (which is rarely done in that part of linguistics). But we need to stop pretending that we have indisputable sciences which tell us what people should be forced to do. Because we do not. So, I don't think social sciences are scientific enough to justify taking away peoples' freedoms. Especially not those parts of social sciences that are usually cited to justify that.<\/span>";

But the obvious truth is, requiring cars to have ABS brakes also makes them more expensive. So where do you draw the line?

Chances are, they just made the World War 2 even worse, at least on the territory of the modern-day Croatia. And what exactly did the NATO Bombings of Belgrade accomplish apart from killing hundreds or perhaps thousands of civilians? I see no reason to think that played a huge role in ending the war. However, I can see how that probably made Serbians distrust capitalism more, since the USA is, in minds of many people, synonymous with capitalism. The point is, if a super-power gets involved in a war, you can't expect it to have the information it needs to bring peace to people. And if it brings force without being guided (or, perhaps even more probably, being misguided), it is going to make things worse. It's as simple as that. And even if that superpower happens to have the right information (which is unlikely), there is no reason to think it will use it the right way: the decisions are, more often than not, made by politicians with no military experience "

Croatian media are full of stories of there being an imminent danger of the Bosnian Muslims or the Serbian nationalists attacking us, and that we need to invest more in the military. Are those stories credible? Look, I am Croatian, and I have no bright idea. I could think of some arguments why those stories might not be credible. First, they are sensationalist, so they are easily sold to the media. Second, there is a political incentive to make people believe those things, to justify the high taxes that make our country bankrupt, and to justify taking money from the funds of the European Union (that could probably be spent way better). And even if those stories are true, if there indeed are people who will conquer Croatia, how to actually decrease the number of victims? Will the attempt to fight decrease the number of victims? Or, maybe, just maybe, will it actually increase it? Sure, some military operations of the Croatian War of Independence, such as Bljesak (Flash) and Oluja (Storm), are widely agreed to have been one of the best-organized military operations in modern history. But such things are relatively rare. We need to also consider things that the Croatian military did wrong. Governments protecting us in case of a foreign invasion can only work if the military commanders are sane and competent people. Sometimes they are not sane. Slobodan Praljak, for instance, killed many people just because they were of different religion and later killed himself. Sometimes they appear to be incompetent, and to lull people into false sense of security. Perhaps the best example of military lulling people into false sense of security is Vukovar Massacre. Basically, a Serbian named \u0416\u0435\u0459\u043A\u043E \u0420\u0430\u0436\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0438\u045B organized an illegal army to attack a hospital at Vukovar, because it was supposedly filled with people fighting for the independence of Croatia (and therefore deserve to die). The Croatian military was present in the city, and people were certain they were safe from that illegal army. The suggestions about evacuating the hospital were scorned at. However, when the Croatian military leader present in the city, Mile Dedakovi\u0107, warned of the imminent danger, and the president Franjo Tu\u0111man promised to send him weapons (it is a bit <a href=\"https://www.24sata.hr/news/mile-dedakovic-trazio-pomoc-ali-tumana-nisu-htjeli-buditi-243737\">controversial<\/a> whether he even promised to send him weapons)... those weapons mysteriously disappeared. Needless to say, the illegal army killed many people, and the Croatian military ended up doing nothing but having lulled people into false sense of security. This reads like a poorly-written horror story full of plot holes. But you know as they say, reality is weirder than fiction because fiction at least needs to make sense to the author. Events during the war do not need to make sense to anybody, and the plans made by the government to keep its citizens safe in the case of foreign invasion often turn out to be gibberish. BBC news at the time even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2988304.stm\">suggested</a> the Croatian government let Vukovar Massacre happen on purpose. I do not believe that, but I cannot deny the Croatian government handled it worse than if they did nothing. Most people in Croatia agree that having weapons is not a right, but a privilege to be earned. Yet, somehow, most of them agree the Croatian government somehow deserves to have weapons. Well, I fail to see why. And I think all governments are like that. Sure, not all governments are equal. Varivode Massacre, committed by the Croatian government, is nothing compared to the Srebrenica Massacre, committed by the Serbian government. But which government that has existed for more than a few decades doesn't have dark history? Then, why would governments deserve to have weapons? So, if I, as somebody who lives in Croatia, don't know those things, how could some American politician know?</span>";

It probably feels good to punish the evil-doers with prisons and jails. But does it do good? It's hard to see how it could. I can see how people can think death penalty or gun control actually do good, but, let's face it, the evidence doesn't support that either. It feels good to legislate laws against abortion. But does it do good? Well, there are probably a few women who might change their minds because of those laws. But the vast majority of women who would otherwise do abortion legally would end up doing abortion illegally, risking their own life by that. It feels good to legislate minimum wage laws, thinking you are increasing the pleasure of the exploited. However, does it do good? Sure, a few workers, who had a wage slightly lower than the new minimum wage, will get a pay raise. But those that actually had very low wages, significantly lower than the new minimum wage, will end up losing their jobs because of the minimum wage, and so too will many people who would otherwise get an entry-level job lose that opportunity."

One cannot talk himself into mental health, and pretending that it can be done hurts those who need help the most. Or the child labor laws. Sure, laws against child labor might help a child whose parents are brainwashed into opposing education. But it will hurt those desperately poor families to which child labor makes a significant portion of income. Sometimes child labor is the only way for a family not to starve. Or the net neutrality laws. Sure, they probably help an average Internet user. But they put a burden on last-mile ISPs, and the people in remote villages who have no Internet access are hurt the most by the net neutrality laws. Similarly with laws regarding the quality of electricity. Laws demanding high-quality electricity might help people with complicated electronics that can indeed be damaged by brownouts or strong higher harmonics. But what about people who don't have any electricity in their houses and who just want to use electricity for light? Arguably, they are being hurt by those laws. Or the policies regarding the conservation of languages. We can discuss whether it is a good thing to have multiple languages in a society (personally, I do not think it is), but those policies undoubtedly burden the low-income people, as it is usually the low-income people who happen to know the nearly-extinct languages. In all those cases, while it is possible that government policies help an average person, they hurt precisely those who need help the most."

        I hope the way I communicated the libertarian ideas made you think. I
        realize that they are hard to accomplish, because many people like the
        false sense of security and justice the laws give them. But the first
        step towards achieving some political goal is to speak out about it.<br />It's
        difficult to convince people to value freedom. It's much easier to
        convince them that giving up liberty somehow makes a society better.
        It's instinctual to think that taking away peoples' freedom and
        controlling what they do somehow makes them more economically efficient.
        That's why we had the things such as slavery, fascism and communism.
        Even when you do convince people to value freedom, there is often a
        state holding them back. For instance, the government was one who was
        putting the liberators of the slaves into prisons. And violent
        revolutions are, exactly because of that, counter-productive. If the
        vast majority of people believe government is necessary for safety,
        overthrowing a government usually leads to an even more oppressive
        government forming.<br /><br /><i
          >What happened to me so that I became a libertarian? Well, I realized
          that the government-backed-up pseudosciences destroyed my childhood
          and teenage years. After my parents got bitterly divorced, somebody
          from the social security (and I am quite sure I know exactly who, but
          I won't name them here) made up a story that my father was a rapist
          and that I was a witness. Since they were in the government, many
          people believed them back then, including my mother. Both my parents
          lost their jobs and gave all the money I was supposed to start my life
          with to lawyers. That story was well-known, and nobody wanted to be a
          friend with me. I was lonely (thankfully, I am an only child, so I
          didn't have to share this little money my parents were able to spend
          on me with my siblings), and I became a part of a group of vandals and
          alcoholics. Additionally, my mother ended up in jail for a year.
          Government might steal money from my fellow citizens and give it to me
          in compensation, but it cannot give me my childhood and teenage years
          back. Even today, I sometimes get asked whether there is some truth to
          that story about my father. Uncomfortable, I answer that there isn't,
          but that that story, because the government got involved, had very
          real and devastating consequences. I am no longer an alcoholic and a
          vandal, and I am relatively respected among the people who know me.
          But to prevent other people from getting into such situations, I want
          to send a message: "Don't ascribe superpowers to the people in your
          government." That means don't believe ridiculous conspiracy theories,
          but also don't believe that the government can do miracles to protect
          us.</i

          civitates oeconomice parum strenuas facere, et quod libertas, quodam
