      <p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px">
        <br />There are statistics that show that governments (mainly socialism
        and communism) have, in recent times, killed many more people than
        murderers, or even wars, did. It's a phenomenon called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide">democide</a>.<br />
        <br />Some famous people that call themselves libertarians are the
        linguist Noam Chomsky and the Nobel-prize winning economist Milton
        Friedman. They have wildly different visions about how the economy will
        function without a government, but both agree government should not
        intervene into it.<br />
        <br />Somalia is often alleged to be evidence of the lack of a
        government causing violence. However, in 2004, after being stateless for
        more than a decade, its murder rate was less than half of the Africa's
        average murder rate. Many say it is primarily because guns are hard to
        acquire there, though.<br />

        <br />
        <b>TL;DR</b>: If we should have a government at all, it should be one
        based on science. And modern-day social sciences, and (perhaps
        especially so) fields of science that combine natural and social
        sciences, are not yet scientific enough to allow us to base governments
        on them. Modern-day social sciences usually just give governments false
        confidence that their policies are correct and, to quote Clive Staples
        Lewis, forbid wholesome doubt. Therefore, we should not have a
        government. If we were perfect, then we should be living in a
        technocratic dictatorship. But, clearly, we are so far from perfect that
        anarchy is better. I became a libertarian because government-backed-up
        pseudosciences put my mother and almost my father in jail. (<i>UPDATE: You know what, now I agree with Ayn Rand that this &quot;freedom is good because we are not perfect&quot; is medieval thinking in post-industrial age and is getting things precisely backwards. We need laws (and probably the government) because of the things such as the fact that we will not have lab-grown eggs any time soon, so lab-grown animal products will not address the problem of superbacteria any time soon. We need laws to make the Internet work because the protocols used on the Internet are not (and probably cannot be) perfect, and there seems to be no technical solution to the problem of Internet service providers setting up open DNS servers so that they can be used for DNS reflection attacks. In other words, we need laws and somebody to enforce them because we are not perfect. If we were perfect, <b>then</b> we should be living in an anarchy.</i>)<br />

        The word "libertarianism" is defined as "a belief in human free will".
        Now, the phrase "belief in" has two quite distinct meanings: one is the
        belief that something exists, and the other one is the belief that
        something is reliable.

        In politics, it's mainly used in the second sense. In fact, as a
        political libertarian, I am not even sure whether free will itself is an
        illusion, and that seems quite a bit irrelevant to me. The basic
        principle of libertarianism (called non-aggression-principle) is that
        initiation of force is always immoral. The same applies to the things
        where other people (libertarians call people who are not libertarians
        <i>statists</i>, from <i>state</i>, a rare word meaning
        <i>country</i> or <i>government</i>) believe that it's justified, like
        the police.<br />
        Libertarianism has a bad name. Its adherents are often said to be
        selfish and greedy. But the same is true for many other political
        opinions that aren't popular. That's because its arguments aren't
        communicated in a good way (they're often accompanied by things such as
        global warming denial, or nonsense and insulting phrases such as
        <i>all cops are bastards</i>), or worse, they aren't being communicated
        at all.

        I hope the way I communicated the libertarian ideas made you think. I
        realize that they are hard to accomplish, because many people like the
        false sense of security and justice the laws give them. But the first
        step towards achieving some political goal is to speak out about it.<br />It's
        difficult to convince people to value freedom. It's much easier to
        convince them that giving up liberty somehow makes a society better.
        It's instinctual to think that taking away peoples' freedom and
        controlling what they do somehow makes them more economically efficient.
        And maybe if human beings were perfectly rational and had access to
        perfect information (so that game theory could be used to model human
        behavior), these instincts would be correct. Those instincts are why we
        had the things such as slavery, fascism and communism. And violent
        revolutions are, exactly because of that, counter-productive. If the
        vast majority of people believe government is necessary for safety,
        overthrowing a government usually leads to an even more oppressive
        government forming. Even when you do convince people to value freedom,
        there is often a state holding them back. For instance, the government
        was one who was putting the liberators of the slaves into prisons. <i>(UPDATE on 25/08/2025: Now I think there is an even more fundamental reason why libertarianism is difficult to achieve. Namely, the fact that an average person seems to have almost-inverted bullshit detectors when it comes to determining which laws are good and which are not. Yes, we are all bound by tens if not hundreds of thousands of pages of law, and, yes, the vast majority of them are unnecessary if not downright harmful, but an average person is not capable of telling which laws are necessary. An average person, including presumably most politicians, believes in the Hobbesian nonsense of "bellum omnium contra omnes", so it seems to them that the laws against murder are necessary. To me it seems obvious they are harmful, but hardly anybody sees that. And an average person does not understand superbacteria enough to understand why laws against the abuse of antibiotics in the egg industry are necessary, and will be necessary even long after we have lab-grown meat. And an average person does not understand how the Internet works well enough to understand why laws against open DNS servers are necessary. It's not at all obvious how to solve that problem.)</i><br />
        Democracy is arguably better than theocracy, in fact, as I explained in
        my
        <a href="Simulation#TheocracyWorseThanCommunism"
          >blog-post about atheism</a
        >, I believe theocracy is the worst form of government, because it is
        most immune to logic and evidence showing its policies are bad. But that
        does not mean that, if you try to install a democracy in a theocracy
        such as Afghanistan, you will succeed. In fact, attempting to install
        democracy in a country where people are indoctrinated into thinking
        theocracy is good and that education is bad (no idea how they make that
        compatible with Islam in their heads), is arguably counter-productive. I
        think all countries are like Afghanistan in that regard, having
        indoctrinated population not willing to fight for good principles, in
        fact, they are indoctrinated to fight against them. Almost everybody
        these days, and the same is true in history, is indoctrinated into
        thinking government overreach is not an issue, or at least not as big of
        an issue as it actually is.<br />
        In a world in which people were rational, or at least a significant
        percentage of people was rational (so that they would make a good
        government), eugenics and government telling people what to eat would
        certainly be good things. Government overreach would not be a concern.
        In the imperfect world where we live, we need to make trade-offs between
        the useful things government does and avoiding government overreach, and
        the trade-off that avoids government overreach is, as far as I can tell,
        always better. In a rational world, it would be a good thing to get rid
        of genetic diseases by preventing people with them from procreating. In
        real world, we need to ask ourselves how big the intended effects would
        be, would government even do those things properly, and whether it is
        worth the government overreach. Given that only around 3% of deaths are
        caused by a known genetic anomaly, eugenics would be a giant government
        overreach with, at best, minimal health benefits. Also, real-world
        governments that tried to do eugenics arguably did not do it properly:
        killing entire ethnicities with no evidence of genetic disease (as Nazis
        were doing) will, if anything, make our gene pool less fit, rather than
        more. Nutritional scientists mostly agree that around 17% of fatal heart
        disease these days is caused by saturated fat. The associations between
        sugar and type-2-diabetes and between heme iron and colon cancer are
        significantly weaker. So, given that around 11% of deaths are due to
        heart disease, government forcing people what to eat will, at best,
        reduce the number of deaths per year by around 2%. Would that be worth
        the government overreach? I do not think so. Especially not since
        real-world governments do not seem to give proper nutritional advice, so
        the actual decrease in mortality will be way less than around 2%, if
        there would be any at all (It is hard to tell how many deaths are indeed
        caused by inadequate nutrition. There is this perception that Vitamin K
        deficiency, agruably the biggest cause of heart disease historically, is
        gone, although the evidence tells us otherwise. There is also this
        perception that scurvy is gone, when, in fact, around 12% of people
        these days suffer from Vitamin C deficiency, the vast majority of that
        being undiagnozed or wrongly diagnozed as something else. I have asked a
        <a
          href="https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-percentage-of-deaths-in-the-US-are-caused-by-food-It-is-estimated-that-17-of-heart-deaths-is-caused-by-saturated-fat-and-the-association-between-sugar-and-diabetes-and-between-heme-and-cancer-are-significantly"
          >Quora question</a
        >
        about it. Nevertheless, I do not consider that relevant, as the
        government cannot address the problems it refuses to acknowledge even
        exist, that are widespread Vitamin K and Vitamin C deficiencies.). Some
        people think a significant percentage of COVID-19 patients would have
        been saved by government forcing people to follow a good diet, but, in
        my opinion, even that is questionable. Suppose everybody in some country
        has type-2-diabetes, that makes COVID-19 deadly. In that country, who
        would be those people spreading COVID without realizing they are
        infected? Almost nobody, right? Which is presumably why COVID-19 did not
        spread as much in countries most plagued by type-2-diabetes, that are
        Sudan and Papua New Guinea. Slightly decreasing type-2-diabetes in Sudan
        or Papua New Guinea would obviously lead to more COVID-19 deaths, rather
        than less. Relationship between rates of type-2-diabetes and COVID-19
        deaths is obviously a Laffer Curve it is hard to tell where the peak is
        and whether we are on the left of that peak or on the right of that
        peak. And let's not forget there are some rare germs, such as the Bird
        Flu, which kill people by turning their immune system against them, and
        good diet in a Bird Flu pandemic may even be counter-productive. And the
        same probably goes for your ideas about what the government should do:
        it would have, at best, minimal benefits, while resulting in a lot of
        dangerous increase in government power.<br />
        Achieving libertarianism would require a giant paradigm shift in the way
        most people think about politics. People usually consider sovereignity
        of countries to be a good thing. Libertarians do not, we hate the idea
        that some fallible government should have absolute power. People usually
        consider equality before the law to be a good thing, except, in recent
        times, for vaccination companies. People have started to realize holding
        vaccination companies liable for incredibly rare (if real) severe
        side-effects of vaccination discourages investment in this essential
        business and does more harm than good. Hopefully people will soon
        realize the same is true not just for vaccination (<a
          href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/elon-musk-launch-regulations-broken-after-delayed-spacex-launch.html"
          >Elon Musk</a
        >, for example, seems to realize that, when he said that the only way to
        innovate in today's society is to ignore the laws and hope nothing
        happens to you because of that). Most people consider rule of law to be
        a good thing. But rule of law only makes sense if laws are good, and
        libertarians think the vast majority of laws we have are bad, and that
        it is a good thing they are not always enforced. Most people think
        corruption is always bad, that it is never a good thing if the
        government breaks its own laws. Libertarians think corruption is a
        symptom of a bigger problem of stupid senseless laws, and that
        eliminating the corruption while doing nothing about the underlying
        problem often does more harm than good.<br />
        People tend to think it is important who is on power, and that, if they
        were on power, things would probably be better. For example, people tend
        to describe Dalai Lama and Mao as mass murderers. In reality, if you
        were in their shoes, you would probably have done the same, afraid for
        your life and realizing how powerless you actually are. Imagine that you
        are Dalai Lama receiving a letter saying &quot;<i
          >We are about to do some ritual, and, for that ritual, we need
          this-many cut-off hands and this-many cut-off heads. Order your army
          to kill or mutilate some Chinese people to deliver that to us... or
          else we will kill you and replace you with somebody else.</i
        >&quot;. What would you have done? What would you have done if you were
        in Mao's shoes when he went to investigate reports of mass starvation in
        Henan, and people there replanted rice from multiple acres into one to
        make it look like the crops had not have failed? People who appear to be
        on power are usually powerless to change anything, and are often also
        unaware of what is really going on (or at least the extent of the
        problem). During history, rulers have often been intentionally kept
        ignorant, as in the case of Potemkin Villages. And when they are not,
        they have little incentive to actually inform themselves. This is true
        even today and in relatively free countries: in his big speech, the US
        president Joe Biden said that almost all Americans have been vaccinated
        against COVID-19 (<a
          href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-350-million-vaccinated-b1898382.html"
          >354 million of them</a
        >), when, in fact, less than half of them have been, due to logistical
        problems and vaccine hesitancy. He was arguably less informed about the
        issue than an average person is, so no wonder he cannot even begin to
        solve the problem. Clearly, world leaders of today are mostly just as
        ignorant as Hui Jin when he said &quot;<i
          >If they have no rice, let them eat meat.</i
        >&quot; or as the anonymous princess in the Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
        Confessions (often said to be Marie Antoinette, even though that is
        unlikely) who said &quot;<i>If they have no bread, let them eat cake.</i
        >&quot;, and Mao was a rule rather than an exception when it comes to
        that. If the country you are governing had been struck by famine for
        decades, and there comes a biologist called Lysenko claiming to have a
        solution, and many (though not most of them) biologists agreed with him,
        there is a very good chance you would implement their policies much like
        Stalin and Mao did. When their country was plagued by the COVID-19
        pandemic, an illness with, at that time, no known cure or prevention,
        which appeared to mostly be spread by asymptomatic individuals while
        being very deadly to elderly people and other people with low immunity,
        and there was a group of scientists claiming that lockdowns and mask
        mandates could curb the pandemic, the vast majority of governments
        implemented policies similar to those that those scientists were
        suggesting. Obviously, those policies did not turn out to be nearly as
        harmful as Lysenkoism turned out to be (though, you cannot deny those
        warnings early in the pandemic, that suicide spikes caused by lockdowns
        might outweight any possible protection against COVID-19 that lockdowns
        could provide, were reasonable, after all, it seems now that they turned
        out to be true at least for teenagers), but they are similarly
        poorly-designed experiments (we still do not know beyond reasonable
        doubt whether they work) everybody was forced to participate in. Really
        makes you wonder how are most people today, including most politicians,
        really different from Stalin and Mao, does not it? Are modern
        politicians simply in different situations, rather than being
        significantly more competent and well-intentioned? Clearly, if their
        country is in some situation which seems hopeless, and there comes a
        group of scientists claiming without good evidence to have a solution,
        modern politicians are willing to force everybody to participate in a
        poorly-designed experiment to test whether that solution works. Yet,
        people seem to be obsessed with who is in power, as if that was likely
        to make a difference. The Croatian ex-prime-minister Ivo Sanader has
        been serving a sentence in Remetinec jail since 2012 for the abuse of
        power, and most people (at least those who have not been enough
        brainwashed by the right-wing propaganda to think the things he was
        convicted of did not actaully happen; I have asked a
        <a
          href="https://www.quora.com/Was-Remetinec-the-part-of-Zagreb-where-the-prison-is-in-which-the-Croatian-politician-Ivo-Sanader-is-serving-a-long-sentence-for-the-abuse-of-power-called-Remetinec-before-the-prison-Why-would-somebody-call-a-part"
          >Quora question</a
        >
        about that) think that happened only because we chose the wrong party at
        the election and that him ending up in jail is justice. In reality,
        justice would be if the society is structured so that such things cannot
        happen, and somebody else would have probably done the same if they were
        in their shoes. Restricting the government so it can do no harm is way
        more important than enabling it to do something good by forcing people
        to do things against their will. Such a paradigm shift in thinking, that
        people stop worrying about who is on power, and start worrying about
        what incentives people on power actually have, is hard to accomplish.<br />
        Even when people indeed are thinking about incentives, which is closer
        to the right way to think about political philosophy, they are often
        replacing real-world governments with something imaginary. They are
        often doing the same mistake as Thomas Hobbes did when he said an
        absolute ruler has an incentive to rule wisely because he can get more
        tax money if the society he is ruling is prosperous. That is extremely
        detached from reality: absolute rulers have an incentive not to rule
        wisely (poor peasants not making good revolutionaries, absolute rulers
        often being threatened by other people in the government that they will
        kill them if they does not kill their political opponents...) and often
        do not even have the ability to rule wisely (they are being actively
        misled about what is going on in the country by Potemkins in the
        government, and, more generally, social sciences are not yet advanced
        enough to tell rulers how to rule wisely).

          >What happened to me so that I became a libertarian? Well, I realized
          that the government-backed-up pseudosciences destroyed my childhood
          and teenage years. After my parents got bitterly divorced, somebody
          from the social security (and I am quite sure I know exactly who, but
          I won't name them here) made up a story that my father was a rapist
          and that I was a witness. Since they were in the government, many
          people believed them back then, including my mother. Both my parents
          lost their jobs and gave all the money I was supposed to start my life
          with to lawyers. That story was well-known, and nobody wanted to be a
          friend with me. I was lonely (thankfully, I am an only child, so I
          didn't have to share this little money my parents were able to spend
          on me with my siblings), and I became a part of a group of vandals and
          alcoholics. Additionally, my mother ended up in jail for a year (you
          can see excerpts from <a href="letter.html">a letter</a> I wrote to
          her back then). Government might steal money from my fellow citizens
          and give it to me in compensation, but it cannot give me my childhood
          and teenage years back. Even today, I sometimes get asked whether
          there is some truth to that story about my father. Uncomfortable, I
          answer that there isn't, but that that story, because the government
          got involved, had very real and devastating consequences. I am no
          longer an alcoholic and a vandal, and I am relatively respected among
          the people who know me. But to prevent other people from getting into
          such situations, I want to send a message: "Don't ascribe superpowers
          to the people in your government." That means don't believe ridiculous
          conspiracy theories, but also don't believe that the government can do
          miracles to protect us.</i

        Latin I posted there:

          Quid cogitatis de anarchismo? Ego anarchista sum, ego cogito melius
          esse, si imperia et leges non essent. Ego non video, quomodo possint
          bonae leges existere? Quomodo possint leges imperiaque societatem
          protegere? Consideretis: Nemo, qui non insanus est, vult aliquem
          occidere. Et militia venit solummodo postquam insanus homo occidat
          aliquem. Et tunc militia sinit eum insanum hominem in carcerem. Carcer
          non est (et probabiliter non potest esse) locus ubi is insanus homo
          sanus futurus est, carcer locus est ubi is plus insanus factus erit.
          Ergo, is insanus homo, qui suae insanitatis causa aliquem occidit,
          insanior revertetur in societatem.<br />
          Securitas, quae nobis data a militia est, falsa est. In saeculis
          historiae, etsi custodes et equites omnes spectabant et custodiebant,
          non poteras, viis in urbibus iens, securus a latronibus esse.<br />
          Et de rebus oeconomicis... Linguae videntur esse sine imperiis posse.
          Si linguae sine imperiis possunt esse, cur oeconomia non possit?<br />
          Et de rebus bellorum... Paene omnia bella horum temporum pugnae sunt,
          ut omnia bella cessent. Sed bella numquam bella inhibere succedent. Et
          tela solummodo raris temporibus veniunt ubi debentur, arma bonorum
          hominum saepe veniunt in malas manus.<br />
          Civitates amant falsam securitatem, quod leges et imperia dant eis.
          Difficile pugnare contra ei est. Multi homines censent libertatem
          civitates oeconomice parum strenuas facere, et quod libertas, quodam
          modo, facit homines res, quae non rationales sunt, facere. Id est cur
          habebamus Fascismum, Communismum et servos. Sed possumus sperare
          numerum eorum hominum, qui libertatem non amant, minorem in futuro
          esse.

          risk of getting into such lawsuits is rather high. If it is him, it is
          sad that a singer who writes and sings anti-police songs will sue

          <b>What the law is actually saying:</b> Let's ban assault weapons
          (automated guns that may actually come useful in self-defense
          situation when every second counts), while leaving the guns that are
          actually used in mass shootings legal. And let's make it illegal for
          mentally ill people to have any guns (never mind mentally ill people
          are also more likely to be the victims). Who cares about the
          constitution and privacy of medical information?<br />

          people engage in such crimes remains unaddressed.

                work! Neatherlands has a high vaccination rate, yet cases are
                spiking there. Government is lying about how effective the

                Vaccines only start working after 2 weeks, and in some people
                only after 4 weeks. And even then, it is hardly responsible to
                go dancing as long as the virus is circulating around. Getting
                vaccinated decreases your chance of spreading COVID-19 if you
                catch it only by around 45%, and there are still many
                uvaccinated vulnerable people around. Furthermore, vaccines do
                not exactly reduce the chance of vaccinated 75-year-olds dying
                from COVID-19 down to zero, they are about as immune as

          And, by the way, it is hard to tell whether &quot;<i
            >As soon as we all get vaccinated, we can return to normal.</i
          >&quot; is true. The answer to that depends on the variables we cannot
          reliably estimate, such as the R0 of the new variants and how much
          vaccination protects against infections (that is, how common are
          asymptomatic breakthrough infections, which, without a doubt, usually
          go undetected). It is quite possible that herd immunity against
          COVID-19 is impossible and that everybody, including immunocompromised
          for which vaccines do not work, will sooner or later get infected, and
          that massive vaccination is, at best, buying time for new effective
          treatments to be discovered. Also, as the
          <a
            href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/breakthrough-cases-cdc-analysis/index.html"
            >CNN puts it</a
          >: &quot;<i
            >And it's hard to be confident that the virus is not infecting
            millions of fully vaccinated people and perhaps evolving in their
            bodies under pressure from a vaccinated immune system -- a scenario
            that is unlikely but that could, in theory, give rise to new
            vaccine-impervious variants.</i
          >&quot; (this has happened once, in case of a cancer-causing virus in
          chicken called Marek's disease - it has, much like HIV, evolved the
          ability to shut down the immune system before it has a chance to act,
          arguably pressured into doing that by too many chickens being immune
          to it due to vaccination). If some mutation to COVID-19 could enable
          it to shut down the immune system (It is indeed very unlikely, but how
          can you prove that is not true?), massive vaccination is actually
          decreasing the amount of time we have to find effective treatments,
          rather than increasing it. To justify the huge government policy of
          forced vaccination, don't you need to show the horrible consequences
          are impossible, rather than just unlikely? The consequences of you
          getting vaccinated are easy to tell: you are unlikely to have symptoms
          of COVID-19 if infected with current variants, and most likely future
          variants as well. The consequences of policies intended to force
          everybody to get vaccinated are very hard to predict.

          >things not related to politics</i
        >&quot;, meant &quot;<i>private</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>one's own</i
        >&quot; in Ancient Greek, it is just that the word has changed its
        meaning over centuries drastically.<br /><br />

            you got 2 arms 2 legs.<br />
            <br />
            does the mayor take personal responsibility if you personally get
            attacked?<br />
            not unless crime is so rampant in your neighbourhood.<br />
            feel free to sue the mayor.<br />
            <br />
            but for the 100s of people you meet everyday, do they have the right
            to safety?<br />
            can we trust the gov't has done everything reasonable in their power
            to ensure to know that you, a possibly mentally disturbed person,
            does not have a gun?<br />
            <br />
            why does a mental person need a gun for the off chance they're
            attacked?<br />
            are you so paranoid that someone's out to get you?<br />
            you believe the earth is flat and there's gov't conspiracy against
            you?<br />
            <br />
            ya... no sorry i'm pretty sure the risk to others outweighs the risk
            to you.
          </div>
          No, I am not a Flat-Earther, nor do I think there is a massive
          conspiracy against me. I simply think laws that prevent the prevention
          of a crime are bad laws and that people who want such laws are partly
          responsible for the crimes they cause, if I was not clear enough. Laws
          that require psychological tests for somebody to own a gun can easily
          prevent the prevention of a violent crime, since mentally ill people
          are often victims of violent crime. They are taking away guns from
          those who are more likely to be victims of violent crime. If passing
          such a law is not irresponsible, I do not know what is.
        </div>
        It is amazing to me that the people on the Flat Earth Society forum tend
        to be rather anti-gun. I'd expect Flat-Earthers to be anti-government
        and therefore pro-gun, but apparently I was wrong about that. Guns often
        save lives. Every study about that that I am aware of shows that guns
        save at least as many lives per year as they take, if not a lot more. As
        such, any gun control policy is risky at best. It is amazing to me just
        how certain gun control advocates are that their policy would save more
        lives than it takes, and not only that, but also being utterly incapable
        of accepting any responsibility for the harm it might cause.<br /><br />

        UPDATE on 08/12/2022: People on AtheistForums insist that Irish Potato

        How can anybody think that way is truly beyond me. In my opinion, the
        Irish Potato Famine may be classified as an intentional genocidal
        policy, similar to Holodomor.<br /><br />

        Once again, how anybody can think that way is beyond me. I am not saying
        communism inevitably leads to something like Great Chinese Famine. But
        it's hard to imagine how pseudoscience such as Lysenkoism could have
        such disasterous consequences in a capitalist society.<br /><br />

        <div class="quotation" lang="la">
          <p>
            Quid homines in hac agora censent de legibus quae prohibunt civibus
            sclopeta habere? Ego censeo quia, et si utimur logica planae terrae
            (quod Anglice dicitur "Flat-Earth logic") et si utimur logica
            sphaerae terrae (quod Anglice dicitur "Round-Earth logic"), debeamus
            esse contra eas leges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Si sequimur logicam planae terrae... Ego vivo in Croatia et ego
            numquam vidi sclopetum. Etiam, sclopeta (etiam bombi) apparent
            contradicere secundae legi thermodynamicae. Secunda lex
            thermodynamicae docet nobis quia nullum corpus potest agere laborem
            (productum fortiae et distantiae, quod metimur in joulibus) ex sua
            ipsius energia internale. Per secundam legem thermodynamicae,
            corpus, ut possit laborem facere, debet energiam accipere ab alio
            altero corpore. Sed sclopeta (et bombi) apparet eo contradicere. Cum
            premimus scandalam sclopeti, damus ei parvam energiam, sed id
            sclopetum dat proiectili magnam kineticam energiam. Ut id faciat,
            sclopetum debeat uti sua energia internale, annon? Ego non sum
            physicista, ego studebam scientiae computatrali in universitate, sed
            id est quomodo id apparet mihi. Ergo, ego nescio num sclopeta vere
            exsistant. Et si imperium attentat regulare aliquid quod nescimus
            num vere exsistat, id est solummodo potentiam praehendere (quod
            Anglice dicitur "power-grab"), annon?
          </p>

          <p>
            Si sequimur logicam sphaerae terrae...<br />
            Anno Domini 1995-o, Americanus sociologista cum nomine Gary Kleck
            fecit studiam quae aestimat quot vitas sclopeta servant in uno anno.
            Is quinque milia tempora diligit fortuitum numerum in telephone et
            quaerabat homines num, abhinc unum annum, utabantur sclopetum in
            defensa. Is aestimavit quia id fiat in America circa 2'000'000
            tempora in uno anno. In 16% eorum casuum, homines censebant se
            mortuos fuisse si non habuerunt cum se sclopetum. Ergo, si ii
            homines veritatem dicunt, sclopeta servant circa 400'000 vitas in
            uno anno in America. Pro comparatione, per statisticas imperii
            Americae, sclopeta occidunt circa 50'000 homines in uno anno. Et
            plurimi ex eis 50'000 hominibus occiderunt se ipsum. Prohibitio
            sclopetorum paene certe non servaret eos qui usi sunt sclopetis ut
            se ipsos occidant, quia multae sunt viae se occidendi sine sclopeto.
            Ergo, si id Gary Kleck studium verum sit, prohibitio sclopetorum
            probabiliter servaret minus quam 50'000 homines in uno anno, sed ea
            occidat circa 400'000 homines in uno anno.<br />

            quae examinat fabulas in mediis de massivis occidendis in America.
            In circa 40% casuum, ea occidenda finiunt cum aliquis cives cum
            sclopeto offendit homicidam. Si sclopeta prohibita sunt,
            possibiliter id sit plus difficile pro homicida sclopetum
            praehendere, sed facere massivum occidendum esset facilius, quia
            boni homines non haberent sclopeta ut finiant massivum occidendum.
            Id est probabiliter cur paene omnia massiva occidenda fiunt in locis
            in quibus hominibus non licet sclopeta cum se ferre (quod Anglice
            dicitur &quot;gun-free zones&quot;).

        <span id="more_about_social_sciences">UPDATE</span> on 28/09/2024: One
        more thing I've noticed about the difference between natural and social
        sciences is the following. In natural sciences, if you want to claim
        some experiment is flawed, you usually have to find some flaw in the
        experimental setup. In social sciences, however, you can usually
        discredit an experiment by saying &quot;<i
          >Perhaps a more appropriate mathematical model would suggest the
          pattern is not actually statistically significant.</i
        >&quot;. To understand what I mean, look at the case of the k-r pattern
        in <a href="toponyms.html">the Croatian river names</a>. I say: &quot;<i
          >Such a pattern cannot be due to chance. We need to explain it somehow
          differently. I suggest that *karr~kurr was the Illyrian word for 'to
          flow'...</i
        >&quot;. Proponents of mainstream linguistics say: &quot;<i
          >You are fallling for the Birthday Paradox.</i
        >&quot;. I then do numerical calculations which show that, under
        standard assumptions, the Birthday Paradox is not remotely an
        explanation for that pattern, that it suggests that the probability of
        such a pattern occurring due to chance is somewhere around 1/10'000.
        Then the proponents of mainstream linguistics say: &quot;<i
          >Well, you need to adjust for the collision entropy of the Croatian
          language.</i
        >&quot;. Then I do some measurements and calculations and come to the
        conclusion that the p-value of that k-r pattern in the Croatian river
        names is somewhere around 1/500. Then the proponents of mainstream
        lingustics say: &quot;<i
          >Well, you need to measure the collision entropy of different parts of
          the grammar of the Croatian language, such as phonotactics and the
          rest of the phonology, syntax, morphology...</i
        >&quot;. Then I actually did that, and I came to the conclusion that the
        p-value of that k-r pattern is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17. Then
        the proponents of mainstream linguistics say: &quot;<i
          >But what if different types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives...) in
          the Croatian language have different collision entropy, and nouns
          (river names being nouns) have a significantly lower collision entropy
          than the rest of the words in the Aspell word-list?</i
        >&quot;. And it seems to me we can go like that... perhaps forever, or
        at least for a very long time (If I had to guess, it would end by me
        making some incredibly technical calculation suggesting that the k-r
        pattern is probably statistically significant, but that will be so
        technical and confusing that nobody will be able to actually understand
        it.). That's hardly a problem in natural sciences, is it?<br /><br />
