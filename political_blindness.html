        Politics is hard to discuss. That is partly because politics makes

        us to reality.<br />
        To understand what I am saying, imagine yourself talking to a Neo-Nazi.
        Neo-Nazis believe (just like Nazis did) that a significant percentage of
        deaths were caused by genetic defects and that eugenics would make the
        society so much healthier that it is worth the lack of freedom eugenics
        means. Neo-Nazis do not necessarily (though they probably do) have
        different values than we do, they live in a world of alternative, and
        empirically wrong, facts. In reality, only around 3% of deaths are
        caused by known hereditary genetic defects. Cancer is mostly caused by
        genetic modification you get <i>after</i> you were born in
        <i>some</i> of your cells (mostly not those related to reproduction),
        and those genetic modifications are caused by radiation, chemicals
        created by burning tobacco, chemicals created by a mixture of heme iron
        and omega-6-acids in presence of the enzymes existing in your colon, and
        so on. That is, not by things eugenics could save us from. Other cancers
        appear to be caused by malformed protein around your DNA turning off
        genes for reproduction control (similar to the Alzheimer's disease -
        protein malformation without apparent change in the DNA coding for those
        proteins), and this seems to be (although that is not proven beyond
        reasonable doubt) somehow associated with high blood sugar. Again, it is
        not clear how eugenics would help. Furthermore, there is an obvious fact
        that Neo-Nazis are loudly denying, and that is that governments that
        actually tried to do eugenics were not following the science when doing
        that, and were actually counter-productive: killing people of different
        ethnicities, with no evidence of genetic disease, arguably makes our
        gene pool less fit.<br />
        Or imagine yourself talking to a vegan extremist who thinks meat is
        responsible for a significant percentage of deaths. They may have the
        same values that you do, but they live in a world of alternative facts.
        It is relatively easy to estimate how many deaths are caused by meat.
        There are essentially two ways meat kills us: saturated fat causing
        heart disease, and heme iron (present only in red meat) mixed with
        omega-6-acids in presence of enzymes present in colon producing
        cancer-causing substances. It is widely agreed upon that around 17% of
        lethal heart disease is caused by saturated fat (but notice saturated
        fat is not found solely in animal products), and maybe around 7% of
        cancers are caused by heme iron. Since both cancer and heart disease are
        responsible for around 11% of deaths each, probably less than 3% of
        deaths are caused by meat. Furthermore, it is hard to imagine government
        telling people what to eat actually following the science. Vegan
        extremists, much like you, presumably value both freedom and public
        health. But they are misled into thinking giving up freedom to eat what
        we want will lead to huge public health benefits. Furthermore, if all we
        are worried about is the effects of meat on human health, are not there
        solutions more likely to work than forced veganism, such as advocating
        preventative use of statins? Although all the pandemics in recent
        history came from eating meat, I fail to see how making meat illegal
        might help about that: with the exception of Spanish Flu (which jumped
        from chickens to humans in a factory farm in Kansas), all the pandemics
        in recent history came from illegal wet markets where animals did not
        receive basic veterinary care (as it was, well, illegal). It being
        illegal to eat bats or monkeys, obviously, did not stop EBOLA and
        COVID-19 from jumping from bats to humans, nor did it stop HIV from
        jumping from monkeys to humans. In fact, it arguably made it more likely
        to happen: those animals receiving basic veterinary care would have
        prevented that. I am, obviously, not denying it is a serious problem,
        but I fail to see how government can solve it.<br />
        Anti-vegetarians are similarly mostly living in an alternative reality
        in which most meat comes from pasture-raised animals, that it
        contributes significantly to the amount of food we have, and that giving
        it up will probably lead to famine. That is also laughably wrong, but at
        least anti-vegetarians do not tend to be political, or at least not as
        authoritarian.<br /><br />
        However, I think that even people who are holding normal political
        positions are just as misinformed, not by alternative media, but by
        mainstream media. Lest we forget that one of the basic principles of
        social sciences is to never doubt the statistics provided by the
        governments. Like Katherine Hirschfeld said: &quot;<i
          >Social scientists frequently cited favorable health statistics
          supplied by these regimes (Cuba...), without critically looking at the
          ways these were created and maintained by state power.</i
        >&quot;. Here are some examples of commonly-held (by most people)
        beliefs related to politics, which I am quite sure are not based on good
        evidence:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >Prisons deter violent crime. Existence of prisons is giving up a
              bit of freedom for a lot of safety.</b
            ><br />Let's rephrase that a bit: &quot;<i
              >Countries with higher incarceration rate tend to be lower in
              crime.</i
            >&quot;<br />Sorry, but the real-world data seems to be strongly
            against this belief. Country with the highest incarceration rate is
            the USA, and it is also a country relatively high in violent crime.
            It probably has higher homicide rate than Somalia, which is, in
            minds of many, a synonym for a high-crime country. The reasons this
            myth is not true, even though it may be instinctual to believe that,
            are actually easy to guess:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Some mentally ill people are not deterred from violent crime by
                the existence of prisons, but are actually provoked by it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Violent criminals are abused in prison by other prisoners, and
                leave the prison even more dangerous (with more psychological
                problems) than when they entered it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Putting petty-criminals into prisons produces the unintended
                <i>learn from the best</i> effect.
              </li>
            </ol>
            I seriously doubt it has to do with other factors: the USA has
            relatively high GDP per capita, which seems to be the best predictor
            of lack of violent crime.<br />
            It is weird to me that almost everybody, left-wing or right-wing,
            who is not an anarchist, believes that. There does not seem to be
            any factual basis for that. Like, the policy of prisons has
            literally less factual basis than the policy of eugenics or forced
            veganism. There is a factual basis for eugenics: some diseases are
            caused by genes, and, if people having those diseases did not
            procreate, we would indeed get rid of them. There is a factual basis
            for forced veganism: meat, especially red meat, sometimes causes
            death, and the vast majority of pandemics do indeed start with meat.
            But there does not seem to be factual basis for the belief that many
            mentally ill people are deterred from doing crime by the existence
            of prisons.

              >Shutting down all non-essential business during a pandemic makes
              people stay home.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, but the real-world data does not quite support that idea.
            Deaths from traffic accidents increased in 2020 compared to 2019,
            rather than decreasing. Data from mobile phones tells a similar
            story. A pandemic is not just a germ, it is also a mass hysteria,
            and seemingly-nonsensible (in minds of the many) policies such as
            shutting down most business fuel that hysteria. You can perhaps
            claim lockdowns worked because people spent less time indoors, that
            those statistics are somehow misleading (that people were speeding
            while driving, offsetting the effect of there being fewer people on
            the road, that data from mobile phones is being misinterpreted...),
            but I see no reason to think those more-complicated explanations are
            true. Most of the people, realizing there is a pandemic, will
            respond by staying home. However, a significant percentage of people
            will panic and react very inappropriately, and it seems as though
            government policies tend to increase that percentage, rather than
            decreasing it.

              >Non-pharmaceutical interventions during a pandemic, such as
              lockdowns and mandatory mask wearing, are effective at leading to
              fewer people dying from the pandemic.</b
            ><br />
            While there are indeed exceptions, such as Australia having strong
            lockdowns and low deaths from COVID-19, or Florida having little
            non-pharmaceutical interventions and having high number of people
            dying from COVID-19 compared to other US states, non-pharmaceutical
            interventions are generally associated with higher deaths from
            COVID-19, rather than lower. Peru had one of the strictest (if not
            the strictest) lockdowns in the world, yet it also had the highest
            number of deaths from COVID-19 in the world. This is especially
            visible in Europe. Scandianvian countries such as Sweden generally
            responded to pandemic by ignoring it, and they had the lowest excess
            mortality in 2020: Sweden had excess mortality of 1.5%, and other
            Scandinavian countries mostly had negative excess mortality. On the
            other hand, other European countries had significantly higher excess
            mortality (Croatia had 17% excess mortality, significantly higher
            than the US, which has 11% excess mortality), in spite of trying all
            kinds of non-pharmaceutical interventions.<br />
            People who are not anarchists generally respond by saying something
            along the lines of &quot;<i
              >Well, this is like saying statin causes high cholesterol because
              people who took statins had high cholesterol. Countries that used
              lockdowns had higher rates of COVID-19 to begin with. You need to
              adjust for other factors.</i
            >&quot;. The problem with that response is that adjusting for other
            factors, if anything, makes it look more like non-pharmaceutical
            interventions are counter-productive, rather than less:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b
                  >You need to adjust for life-expectancy, as COVID-19 almost
                  exclusively kills the elderly, so countries with more elderly
                  people will naturally have higher mortality from COVID-19.</b
                >
                Once again, just eye-balling the data makes it obvious this is
                not true: Scandinavian countries have significantly higher life
                expectancy than Eastern European countries (that were hit by the
                pandemic the most).
              </li>
              <li>
                <b
                  >You need to adjust for the rates of type-2-diabetes, since
                  type-2-diabetes makes COVID-19 far more deadly, and the rates
                  of type-2-diabetes vary widely between countries.</b
                >
                Once again, just eye-balling the sata makes it obvious this is
                not true: Sudan, the country with the highest rate of
                type-2-diabetes, had very few deaths from COVID-19. And the same
                goes for Papua New Guinea. And, when you think about it, it
                actually makes sense. Suppose everybody in some country has
                type-2-diabetes, that makes COVID-19 deadly. In that country,
                who would be those people spreading COVID without realizing they
                are infected? Almost nobody, right? Which is presumably why
                COVID-19 did not spread as much in countries most plagued by
                type-2-diabetes, that are Sudan and Papua New Guinea. Slightly
                decreasing type-2-diabetes in Sudan or Papua New Guinea would
                obviously lead to more COVID-19 deaths, rather than less (but
                probably not more overall mortality). Relationship between rates
                of type-2-diabetes and COVID-19 deaths is obviously a Laffer
                Curve it is hard to tell where the peak is and whether we are on
                the left of that peak or on the right of that peak.

                >
                Once again, just eye-balling the data makes it obvious this is
                not the case: Scandinavian countries, which had the lowest
                excess mortality, are the most distant from the equator of all
                Europe. Peru is also close to the equator.

            </ol>
            Furthermore, it is not obvious that policy responses were driven by
            actual epidemiological situation in the country. Policy responses
            seem to have been driven primarily by whether the public health
            officials were mostly left-wing or right-wing in some country or a
            US state. Left-wing governments around the world generally admire
            the Chinese Communist Party, which pretty much invented strict
            lockdowns as a way of supposedly controlling pandemics, so they
            generally imitated the Chinese Communist Party. Australian
            government is rather supportive of the Chinese Communist Party, so
            no wonder they implemented strict lockdowns. Russian government, for
            example, is openly Trump-supporting, so no wonder they chose not to
            implement strict lockdowns. California has long been a left-leaning
            state, so no wonder they chose to implement strict lockdowns. Texas
            and Florida have long been right-leaning, so no wonder they were lax
            with non-pharmaceutical interventions. There are exceptions: Croatia
            and Bosnia and Herzegovina are arguably more supportive of communism
            (as in being left-wing economically) than Slovenia is, but Slovenia
            had a lot more non-pharmaceutical interventions than Croatia and
            especially Bosnia and Herzegovina. But I do not think anybody would
            doubt that the primary reason some countries had more
            non-pharmaceutical interventions than others is politics, rather
            than proportional responses to COVID-19 cases within them. So, that
            justification for adjusting for other factors (also known as
            p-hacking) is dubious at best.<br />
            I don't doubt you can manipulate the data to find a statistically
            significant (p-value less than 5%) negative correlation between
            non-pharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 mortality, but doing
            that is not science. In science, when the data does not match your
            prediction, you modify your theory. You do not make dozens of new
            hypotheses based on that theory, and, when one of those hypotheses
            appears to predict the data significantly better than chance (and,
            for 20 hypotheses, one of them probably will by chance alone), claim
            that the theory is indeed true.<br />
            Some ways non-pharmaceutical interventions can end up being
            counter-productive include:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Lockdowns fueling the hysteria (people buying unreasonable
                amounts of everyday products leading to shortages and more
                crowded stores) and the protests. While, in some places, such as
                in New York, lockdowns were indeed correlated with lower
                mortality from traffic accidents and lower data about movement
                from mobile phones, and deaths from COVID-19 peaked around three
                weeks after the beginning of a lockdown (and COVID-19 mostly
                kills around three weeks after the infection), this is an
                exception, rather than a rule. In Australia, for example,
                lockdowns were not associated with lower mobile phone data about
                movement. In Delaware, for example, deaths peaked one week after
                the beginning of a lockdown, strongly suggesting actual
                infection rates started falling somewhere around two weeks
                before the lockdown. Clearly, lockdowns have little effect on
                how people are behaving (in fact, they seem to have a negative
                effect), much less on the virus.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consider what dr. Anthony Fauci said at the beginning of the
                pandemic, before changing his stance (arguably for political,
                rather than scientific, reasons):
                <i
                  >Masks, while they do provide some protection, they do not
                  provide the protection people think they provide.
                  <b
                    >And considering that people who are not trained to wear
                    masks tend to often touch their masks if wearing them, and
                    thus contaminating them, masks may even be
                    counter-productive.</b
                  ></i
                >. And, indeed, with the exception of Italy (where it may very
                well be a coincidence) and Israel (but apparently only the first
                mask mandate there, strongly suggesting it is a coincidence -
                the third mask mandate was followed by an obvious speed-up of
                the pandemic), mask mandates were not followed by an obvious
                slowing-down of the pandemic.
              </li>
            </ol>
            It is amazing to me almost everybody agrees non-pharmaceutical
            interventions lead to fewer deaths, and that the disagreement seems
            to be only about whether it is worth the economic damages. Why is it
            so hard to admit that we, as a society, have failed abysmally? We
            are in the middle of a relatively mild pandemic, and to say we were
            unprepared for a pandemic is an understatement. And governments are
            pushing laws which make people wear dirty masks under their nose
            (which is probably counter-productive), and laws that are supposed
            to make people stay home, in spite of the data suggesting those laws
            have the opposite effect. Why is it so hard to state the obvious
            facts?<br />Clearly, we relied on policies misled by simplistic
            computer models making ridiculous assumptions about both natural
            (most of the models assumed asymptomatic people were as likely to
            spread COVID-19 a symptomatic ones, which is clearly wrong as
            symptomatic people emit a lot more droplets) and social sciences.
            This should be viewed as Lysenkoism that just happened to be not as
            damaging. But almost nobody wants to admit that.

            <b
              >Forced vaccinations against COVID-19 protect the
              immuno-compromised for whom vaccines do not work, because
              vaccinated are a lot less likely to spread COVID-19.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, the data seems to be strongly against this. Countries with
            higher vaccination rate mostly have more COVID-19 cases, rather than
            less (Chile, Israel...). While vaccines do indeed decrease the
            spread of COVID-19 by around 45%, and provide some small protection
            (maybe 13%, if the Israeli data is anything to judge by) against
            infection, those protections are more than offset by the changes in
            behavior. Most people vaccinated against COVID-19 do not realize
            they are only slightly less likely to spread COVID-19 (I would wager
            most people think vaccines provide 5 to 10 times the protection
            against spreading, rather than barely around 2 times), and are
            behaving as if they cannot spread it. To put it another way:
            organizing massive celebrations to be attended by vaccinated (as all
            highly-vaccinated countries have been doing) will get more people
            vaccinated, but it will put the immuno-compromised for which
            vaccines do not work in greater danger. If you want to protect
            others, sure, getting vaccinated is a good idea. Wearing a mask is a
            good idea if done properly. But, most importantly, avoid
            superspreader events. That is far more important than getting
            vaccinated (if you are worried primarily about others), yet alone
            wearing a mask.

              That justifies forced vaccination against COVID-19.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, that is just nonsense, for two reasons:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Viruses that have the ability to shut down the immune system
                before it has a chance to act (as to be resistant to
                vaccination) are incredibly rare. As far as I know, there are
                only three of them: HIV, SIV (a virus closely related to HIV
                existing in monkeys) and Marek's Disease (a cancer-causing virus
                in chicken, distantly related to the chickenpox virus).
              </li>
              <li>
                Even if there is a simple mutation to COVID-19 which would
                enable it to shut down the immune system before it has a chance
                to act (which is, again, incredibly unlikely), everybody being
                vaccinated would select <i>for</i> the strains with that
                mutation, rather than <i>against</i> strains with that mutation.
                Which is what happened with the Marek's Disease in chicken: it
                has evolved the ability to shut down the immune system and thus
                be vaccine-resistant in the last 50 years, pressured into doing
                so by almost all chickens being vaccinated against it. Marek's
                disease would likely evolve into an HIV-like virus even without
                mass vaccination of chicken, but mass vaccination of chicken has
                speeded the process up, rather than slowing it down. If there
                were evidence of COVID-19 getting resistant to vaccination (and
                there is no evidence to match such an extraordinary claim), the
                right thing to do would be to halt the vaccination program,
                rather than try to get everybody vaccinated so that the virus
                would replicate less and there supposedly be fewer variants.
                Similarly, the right thing to do in response to many bacteria
                getting resistant to antibiotics is to stop preventative use of
                antibiotics (in animals, in people infected with flu or
                cold...), rather than force everybody to take antibiotics so
                that those bacteria would procreate less and thus supposedly
                leading to fewer variants.
              </li>
            </ol>
            And I think media saying stuff like that is responsible for the
            current suicide pandemic. Claiming without evidence that COVID-19 is
            likely to evolve to be resistant to vaccination (when, in reality,
            that is a very unlikely nightmare scenario) is irresponsible. And
            claiming we as a society are responsible for that (many people being
            hesitand to getting vaccinated) is also irresponsible. If it were
            happening, it would, if anything, be the fault of people at the wet
            market in Wuhan eating bats who did not receive basic veterinary
            care, rather than the fault of people refusing to get vaccinated.

              expensive.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, but nearly all economists agree they, in the long run, make
            food more expensive by increasing the price of arable land, as well
            as making agricultural machinery more expensive. And even if they do
            not, they are hardly worth the increased taxes, which usually
            disproportionately burden the poor.

            ><br />
            If you really believe that, I have a challenge for you: Make a
            computer model implementing how you think languages evolve, and then
            test it against real-world historical data. You may be surprised how
            poorly it performs. I have done that, testing the algorithm in
            <a href="etymologist.html">Etymology Game</a>, and I was surprised
            by how poorly it performs. And, even before that, I was not arrogant
            enough to think I have an idea for a linguistic policy that ought to
            be implemented. If you cannot predict how a language will behave,
            you obviously cannot usefully control it either.

            <b
              >Gun control laws say guns usually used in mass shootings should
              be banned to keep us safe.</b
            ><br />Sorry, but gun control laws generally say exactly the
            opposite. They mostly say that the automated weapons, that are guns
            that may come useful in self-defence when every second counts,
            should be banned, while guns that are generally used in mass
            shootings should remain legal. They are also saying mentally ill
            people ought not to have guns, in spite of the fact that they are
            the group that is most likely to be the victim of violent crime.
            Once you consider what the gun control laws actually say, it seems
            highly implausible they lead to less crime, does not it? And, by the
            way, at least in Europe, gun ownership is not strongly correlated
            with crime. Serbia and Croatia have significantly more guns per
            capita than the UK does, yet UK has significantly more violent
            crime.

            <b>Boycotting sweatshops is good.</b><br />This is believed by both
            left-wing (that they should be banned domestically) and right-wing
            (that we should add barriers to stifle trading with them, and that
            we are protecting illegal immigrants by deporting them out of the
            country so that they will not work jobs which legal immigrants and
            citizens are not willing to do) politicians, but by almost no
            economist. Boycotting sweatshops leads to people being employed
            there get some other job available to them, which are usually worse.
            People are usually in sweatshops because they consider alternatives
            to be even worse, and they are probably right about that (they
            certainly have more insight into the situation of their country than
            we do).

            While you can dismiss the data from Indonesia as unreliable
            (although I seriously doubt it can be wrong by as much as almost two
            orders of magnitude), I see no reason to think data from Serbia is.
          </li>
        </ol>
        I think this was enough examples to see how mainstream political
        ideologies are at odds with the empirical data quite a lot of times,
        perhaps just as much as Neo-Nazism is. Quite often, they are also
        incoherent, and not just at odds with empirical data. I think most
        people believe that:
        <ol>
          <li>
            This is not closely related to politics (it is from the
            vegetarianism debate), but it wonderfully illustrates my point:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b
                  >The omega-3-acid ALA, found in many plants, is not effective
                  at preventing heart attacks, only DHA (found in fish and
                  algae) is, because human body is not good at using ALA.</b
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                <b
                  >Milk from grass-fed cows protects from heart disease because
                  of all the omega-3-acids in it</b
                >
                (the vast majority of them, of course, being ALA).
              </li>
            </ol>
            While you can plausibly claim one of those, you cannot claim both.
            In fact, based on the evidence that I have seen, I would say
            omega-3-acids have no effect whatsoever on heart disease, so both of
            those claims are false.
          </li>
          <li>
            This one is currently popular in politics:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b
                  >Masks can significantly slow down the spread of the COVID-19
                  pandemic because it is mostly spread by asymptomatic
                  people.</b
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                <b
                  >Vaccines significantly slow down the spread of the COVID-19
                  pandemic because people who have no symptoms (vaccinated
                  people) are unlikely to emit enough droplets to infect
                  somebody.</b
                >
              </li>
            </ol>
            While you can plausibly make one of those claims, it should be
            obvious you cannot claim both. Based on the evidence that I have
            seen, I would say vaccines are more effective than masks, but that
            even they can lull people into false sense of security and thus
            increase the spread.
          </li>
        </ol>
        One other thing to note is that, thanks to mainstream media, we are
        living in a world of straw-men, misrepresentations of what people
        actually believe. Examples are:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >Sunetra Gupta thinks the best way of dealing with a pandemic is
              to <i>let it rip</i>, that is, that governments should do
              nothing.</b
            >
            That is absolutely incorrect, she is critical of lockdowns not
            because they supposedly do not work, but because they protect the
            <i>laptop class</i> (those who actually can work from home, which
            tend to be rich people) instead of those who actually need special
            protection from a pandemic (those suffering from, for example,
            hypertension). We can argue that her proposal is unrealistic (and it
            probably is), but we can hardly call her an eugenicist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Allan Savory defends the meat industry as it is, or at least as
              it used to be before factory farming.</b
            >
            Absolutely not, he is proposing that a radical change to extensive
            (not factory farming) animal agriculture could turn it from harmful
            to beneficial in the sense of slowing down soil depletion. So, you
            certainly cannot use Allan Savory's arguments as an excuse to buy
            meat from supermarkets.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Another thing to note is that narrative changes in mainstream media have
        little or nothing to do with what is happening in the real world. 50
        years ago, had you suggested saturated fat did not cause heart disease
        or sugar did not cause type-2-diabetes, you would be considered insane.
        Today, bestseller books and documentaries watched by countless people
        are claiming such things. But there is nothing in science that caused
        such a change. While high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol) was
        discovered and it is possible (but far from proven) it protects against
        heart attacks, the suggestion that a small increase in HDL done by
        saturated fat somehow offsets the huge increase of LDL (low-density
        lipoprotein, which we know causes heart disease as they are pills that
        treat heart disease by lowering it, among others, statins) they do seems
        ridiculous. The suggestion that fructose in sugar does not cause
        type-2-diabetes is, if anything, more absurd now than it was 50 years
        ago. Similarly with masks: at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
        the mainstream media, including Anthony Fauci, was suggesting that mask
        wearing by general population may even be counter-productive, while,
        today, saying that is considered a heresy. Mainstream media would make
        you think there were countless new studies suggesting masks work. But
        that is definitely not how it happened. The danger of nuclear weapons
        being fired accidentally was a normal thing to discuss during the Cold
        War, while, today, suggesting that is considered weird. In reality, the
        danger is even greater now than it was during the Cold War.<br />
        That is why you should not listen only to the mainstream media, but try
        to get a deeper insight into political issues. If you listen only to the
        mainstream media, you will be duped into believing false and sometimes
        even incoherent things. I hope I am helping you with getting a deeper
        insight into political issues.
