        Politics is hard to discuss. That is partly because politics makes
        people live in the world of alternative facts. That is, politics blinds
        us to reality.<br />
        To understand what I am saying, imagine yourself talking to a Neo-Nazi.
        Neo-Nazis believe (just like Nazis did) that a significant percentage of
        deaths were caused by genetic defects and that eugenics would make the
        society so much healthier that it is worth the lack of freedom eugenics
        means. Neo-Nazis do not necessarily (though they probably do) have
        different values than we do, they live in a world of alternative, and
        empirically wrong, facts. In reality, only around 3% of deaths are
        caused by known hereditary genetic defects. Cancer is mostly caused by
        genetic modification you get <i>after</i> you were born in
        <i>some</i> of your cells (mostly not those related to reproduction),
        and those genetic modifications are caused by radiation, chemicals
        created by burning tobacco, chemicals created by a mixture of heme iron
        and omega-6-acids in presence of the enzymes existing in your colon, and
        so on. That is, not by things eugenics could save us from. Other cancers
        appear to be caused by malformed protein around your DNA turning off
        genes for reproduction control (similar to the Alzheimer's disease -
        protein malformation without apparent change in the DNA coding for those
        proteins), and this seems to be (although that is not proven beyond
        reasonable doubt) somehow associated with high blood sugar. Again, it is
        not clear how eugenics would help. Furthermore, there is an obvious fact
        that Neo-Nazis are loudly denying, and that is that governments that
        actually tried to do eugenics were not following the science when doing
        that, and were actually counter-productive: killing people of different
        ethnicities, with no evidence of genetic disease, arguably makes our
        gene pool less fit.<br />
        Or imagine yourself talking to a vegan extremist who thinks meat is
        responsible for a significant percentage of deaths. They may have the
        same values that you do, but they live in a world of alternative facts.
        It is relatively easy to estimate how many deaths are caused by meat.
        There are essentially two ways meat kills us: saturated fat causing
        heart disease, and heme iron (present only in red meat) mixed with
        omega-6-acids in presence of enzymes present in colon producing
        cancer-causing substances. It is widely agreed upon that around 17% of
        lethal heart disease is caused by saturated fat (but notice saturated
        fat is not found solely in animal products), and maybe around 7% of
        cancers are caused by heme iron. Since both cancer and heart disease are
        responsible for around 11% of deaths each, probably less than 3% of
        deaths are caused by meat. Furthermore, it is hard to imagine government
        telling people what to eat actually following the science. Vegan
        extremists, much like you, presumably value both freedom and public
        health. But they are misled into thinking giving up freedom to eat what
        we want will lead to huge public health benefits. Furthermore, if all we
        are worried about is the effects of meat on human health, are not there
        solutions more likely to work than forced veganism, such as advocating
        preventative use of statins? Although all the pandemics in recent
        history came from eating meat, I fail to see how making meat illegal
        might help about that: with the exception of Spanish Flu (which jumped
        from chickens to humans in a factory farm in Kansas), all the pandemics
        in recent history came from illegal wet markets where animals did not
        receive basic veterinary care (as it was, well, illegal). It being
        illegal to eat bats or monkeys, obviously, did not stop EBOLA and
        COVID-19 from jumping from bats to humans, nor did it stop HIV from
        jumping from monkeys to humans. In fact, it arguably made it more likely
        to happen: those animals receiving basic veterinary care would have
        prevented that. I am, obviously, not denying it is a serious problem,
        but I fail to see how government can solve it. It might be a good idea
        to ban preventative use of antibiotics in farmed animals to prevent a
        pandemic of superbacteria, though, and I have asked a
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/vog4ee/what_is_wrong_with_government_banning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3"
          >question on an Internet forum about preventing superbacteria</a
        >.<br />
        Anti-vegetarians are similarly mostly living in an alternative reality
        in which most meat comes from pasture-raised animals, that it
        contributes significantly to the amount of food we have, and that giving
        it up will probably lead to famine. That is also laughably wrong, but at
        least anti-vegetarians do not tend to be political, or at least not as
        authoritarian.<br /><br />
        However, I think that even people who are holding normal political
        positions are just as misinformed, not by alternative media, but by
        mainstream media. Lest we forget that one of the basic principles of
        social sciences is to never doubt the statistics provided by the
        governments. Like Katherine Hirschfeld said: &quot;<i
          >Social scientists frequently cited favorable health statistics
          supplied by these regimes (Cuba...), without critically looking at the
          ways these were created and maintained by state power.</i
        >&quot;. Here are some examples of commonly-held (by most people)
        beliefs related to politics, which I am quite sure are not based on good
        evidence:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >Prisons deter violent crime. Existence of prisons is giving up a
              bit of freedom for a lot of safety.</b
            ><br />Let's rephrase that a bit: &quot;<i
              >Countries with higher incarceration rate tend to be lower in
              crime.</i
            >&quot;<br />Sorry, but the real-world data seems to be strongly
            against this belief. Country with the highest incarceration rate is
            the USA, and it is also a country relatively high in violent crime.
            It probably has higher homicide rate than Somalia, which is, in
            minds of many, a synonym for a high-crime country. The reasons this
            myth is not true, even though it may be instinctual to believe that,
            are actually easy to guess:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Some mentally ill people are not deterred from violent crime by
                the existence of prisons, but are actually provoked by it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Violent criminals are abused in prison by other prisoners, and
                leave the prison even more dangerous (with more psychological
                problems) than when they entered it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Putting petty-criminals into prisons produces the unintended
                <i>learn from the best</i> effect.
              </li>
            </ol>
            I seriously doubt it has to do with other factors: the USA has
            relatively high GDP per capita, which seems to be the best predictor
            of lack of violent crime.<br />
            It is weird to me that almost everybody, left-wing or right-wing,
            who is not an anarchist, believes that. There does not seem to be
            any factual basis for that. Like, the policy of prisons has
            literally less factual basis than the policy of eugenics or forced
            veganism. There is a factual basis for eugenics: some diseases are
            caused by genes, and, if people having those diseases did not
            procreate, we would indeed get rid of them. There is a factual basis
            for forced veganism: meat, especially red meat, sometimes causes
            death, and the vast majority of pandemics do indeed start with meat.
            But there does not seem to be factual basis for the belief that many
            mentally ill people are deterred from doing crime by the existence
            of prisons.<br />
            What's also weird is that stating that you do not believe that
            government makes us safer actually leads to many upvotes on some
            rather
            <a

            /><br />
            Makes you wonder whether people actually believe that government
            makes us safer, or whether it is, to use the phrase the Croatian
            president Zoran Milanovi&#x0107; uses, a &quot;<i
              >North-Korean truth</i
            >&quot; (something everybody pretends to believe; He was referring
            to the idea that banning funerals during the COVID-19 pandemic was a
            good idea, that's a North-Korean truth according to him.). I have
            also asked
            <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/q/80177/39879"
              >a StackExchange question about how non-anarchists explain that
              incarceration rate seems to be positively correlated with violent
              crime, rather than negatively</a
            >.<br />
            Another argument against the existence of prisons and other
            government policies supposed to deter violent crimes which I find
            compelling is the Carl Moody's argument: &quot;<i
              >If you are about to commit a mass shooting, there is a very good
              chance you will die in the process. Many mass shootings end with
              somebody fatally shooting the shooter. And mass shooters are aware
              of that. They are expecting, or even planning, to die in the
              process. If <b>that</b> does not deter them, what makes you think
              something a government can do will? How could, for example, a
              small penalty for illegally owning a gun deter somebody who is
              about to commit a mass shooting?</i
            >&quot;.

          <li>
            <b
              >Animal rights are improving. Livestock is living longer and
              happier lives.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, that's just laughably wrong. 100 years ago, cows used to live
            around 20 years, whereas now they live for 5 or 6 years. 100 years
            ago, chickens used to live for years, now they live for months. We
            can discuss the reasons. Careless breeding (which doesn't take care
            of how long the animals can live, only that they give milk and
            eggs), changes in the diet (leading to obesity preventing animals
            from living long lives)... All of that possibly being incentivized
            by government subsidies... In short, no, animal rights is not a
            self-solving problem. And lab-grown meat will not solve it, because
            it won't give us lab-grown eggs (and eggs are arguably causing more
            animal suffering and environmental problems than meat does: the vast
            majority of antibiotics these days is used in the egg industry). And
            I think the invention of antibiotics made animal rights much worse,
            by making cruel practices profitable.

              >Shutting down all non-essential business during a pandemic makes
              people stay home.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, but the real-world data does not quite support that idea.
            Deaths from traffic accidents increased in 2020 compared to 2019,
            rather than decreasing. Data from mobile phones tells a similar
            story. A pandemic is not just a germ, it is also a mass hysteria,
            and seemingly-nonsensible (in minds of the many) policies such as
            shutting down most business fuel that hysteria. You can perhaps
            claim lockdowns worked because people spent less time indoors, that
            those statistics are somehow misleading (that people were speeding
            while driving, offsetting the effect of there being fewer people on
            the road, that data from mobile phones is being misinterpreted...),
            but I see no reason to think those more-complicated explanations are
            true. Most of the people, realizing there is a pandemic, will
            respond by staying home. However, a significant percentage of people
            will panic and react very inappropriately, and it seems as though
            government policies tend to increase that percentage, rather than
            decreasing it.

              lockdowns and mandatory mask wearing, are effective at leading to
              fewer people dying from the pandemic.</b
            ><br />
            While there are indeed exceptions, such as Australia having strong
            lockdowns and low deaths from COVID-19, or Florida having little
            non-pharmaceutical interventions and having high number of people
            dying from COVID-19 compared to other US states, non-pharmaceutical
            interventions are generally associated with higher deaths from
            COVID-19, rather than lower. Peru had one of the strictest (if not
            the strictest) lockdowns in the world, yet it also had the highest
            number of deaths from COVID-19 in the world. This is especially
            visible in Europe. Scandianvian countries such as Sweden generally
            responded to pandemic by ignoring it, and they had the lowest excess
            mortality in 2020: Sweden had excess mortality of 1.5%, and other
            Scandinavian countries mostly had negative excess mortality. On the
            other hand, other European countries had significantly higher excess
            mortality (Croatia had 17% excess mortality, significantly higher
            than the US, which has 11% excess mortality), in spite of trying all
            kinds of non-pharmaceutical interventions (<i
              >UPDATE: For a reason that escapes me, various sources give me
              different results for excess mortality in 2020 in various
              countries. However, it does appear to be a rule that the number
              for Croatia is slightly bigger than the number for the US, and
              that both are significantly bigger than the number for Sweden. I
              have linked to some sources about it on the righ-hand aside of

            People who are not anarchists generally respond by saying something

              people who took statins had high cholesterol. Countries that used

              adjust for other factors.</i
            >&quot;. The problem with that response is that adjusting for other
            factors, if anything, makes it look more like non-pharmaceutical
            interventions are counter-productive, rather than less:

                goes for Papua New Guinea. And, when you think about it, it
                actually makes sense. Suppose everybody in some country has
                type-2-diabetes, that makes COVID-19 deadly. In that country,
                who would be those people spreading COVID without realizing they
                are infected? Almost nobody, right? Which is presumably why
                COVID-19 did not spread as much in countries most plagued by
                type-2-diabetes, that are Sudan and Papua New Guinea. Slightly
                decreasing type-2-diabetes in Sudan or Papua New Guinea would
                obviously lead to more COVID-19 deaths, rather than less (but
                probably not more overall mortality). Relationship between rates
                of type-2-diabetes and COVID-19 deaths is obviously a Laffer

            Furthermore, it is not obvious that policy responses were driven by
            actual epidemiological situation in the country. Policy responses
            seem to have been driven primarily by whether the public health
            officials were mostly left-wing or right-wing in some country or a
            US state. Left-wing governments around the world generally admire
            the Chinese Communist Party, which pretty much invented strict
            lockdowns as a way of supposedly controlling pandemics, so they
            generally imitated the Chinese Communist Party. Australian
            government is rather supportive of the Chinese Communist Party, so
            no wonder they implemented strict lockdowns. Russian government, for
            example, is openly Trump-supporting, so no wonder they chose not to
            implement strict lockdowns. California has long been a left-leaning
            state, so no wonder they chose to implement strict lockdowns. Texas
            and Florida have long been right-leaning, so no wonder they were lax
            with non-pharmaceutical interventions. There are exceptions: Croatia
            and Bosnia and Herzegovina are arguably more supportive of communism
            (as in being left-wing economically) than Slovenia is, but Slovenia
            had a lot more non-pharmaceutical interventions than Croatia and
            especially Bosnia and Herzegovina. But I do not think anybody would
            doubt that the primary reason some countries had more
            non-pharmaceutical interventions than others is politics, rather
            than proportional responses to COVID-19 cases within them. So, that
            justification for adjusting for other factors (also known as
            p-hacking) is dubious at best.<br />
            I don't doubt you can manipulate the data to find a statistically
            significant (p-value less than 5%) negative correlation between
            non-pharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 mortality, but doing
            that is not science. In science, when the data does not match your
            prediction, you modify your theory. You do not make dozens of new
            hypotheses based on that theory, and, when one of those hypotheses
            appears to predict the data significantly better than chance (and,
            for 20 hypotheses, one of them probably will by chance alone), claim
            that the theory is indeed true.<br />
            Some ways non-pharmaceutical interventions can end up being
            counter-productive include:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Lockdowns fueling the hysteria (people buying unreasonable
                amounts of everyday products leading to shortages and more
                crowded stores) and the protests. While, in some places, such as
                in New York, lockdowns were indeed correlated with lower
                mortality from traffic accidents and lower data about movement
                from mobile phones, and deaths from COVID-19 peaked around three
                weeks after the beginning of a lockdown (and COVID-19 mostly
                kills around three weeks after the infection), this is an
                exception, rather than a rule. In Australia, for example,
                lockdowns were not associated with lower mobile phone data about
                movement. In Delaware, for example, deaths peaked one week after
                the beginning of a lockdown, strongly suggesting actual
                infection rates started falling somewhere around two weeks
                before the lockdown. Clearly, lockdowns have little effect on
                how people are behaving (in fact, they seem to have a negative
                effect), much less on the virus.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consider what dr. Anthony Fauci said at the beginning of the
                pandemic, before changing his stance (arguably for political,
                rather than scientific, reasons):
                <i
                  >Masks, while they do provide some protection, they do not
                  provide the protection people think they provide.
                  <b
                    >And considering that people who are not trained to wear
                    masks tend to often touch their masks if wearing them, and
                    thus contaminating them, masks may even be
                    counter-productive.</b
                  ></i
                >. And, indeed, with the exception of Italy (where it may very
                well be a coincidence) and Israel (but apparently only the first
                mask mandate there, strongly suggesting it is a coincidence -
                the third mask mandate was followed by an obvious speed-up of
                the pandemic), mask mandates were not followed by an obvious
                slowing-down of the pandemic.
              </li>
            </ol>
            It is amazing to me almost everybody agrees non-pharmaceutical
            interventions lead to fewer deaths, and that the disagreement seems
            to be only about whether it is worth the economic damages. Why is it
            so hard to admit that we, as a society, have failed abysmally? We
            are in the middle of a relatively mild pandemic, and to say we were
            unprepared for a pandemic is an understatement. And governments are
            pushing laws which make people wear dirty masks under their nose
            (which is probably counter-productive), and laws that are supposed
            to make people stay home, in spite of the data suggesting those laws
            have the opposite effect. Why is it so hard to state the obvious
            facts?<br />Clearly, we relied on policies misled by simplistic
            computer models making ridiculous assumptions about both natural
            (most of the models assumed asymptomatic people were as likely to
            spread COVID-19 a symptomatic ones, which is clearly wrong as
            symptomatic people emit a lot more droplets) and social sciences.
            This should be viewed as Lysenkoism that just happened to be not as
            damaging. But almost nobody wants to admit that.

            ><br />
            Sorry, the data seems to be strongly against this. Countries with
            higher vaccination rate mostly have more COVID-19 cases, rather than
            less (Chile, Israel...). While vaccines do indeed decrease the

              >around 45%</a
            >, and provide some small protection (maybe 13%, if the Israeli
            data, from the country which massively tests both the vaccinated and
            the unvaccinated, is anything to judge by) against infection, those
            protections are more than offset by the changes in behavior. Most
            people vaccinated against COVID-19 do not realize they are only
            slightly less likely to spread COVID-19 (I would wager most people
            think vaccines provide 5 to 10 times the protection against
            spreading, rather than barely around 2 times), and are behaving as
            if they cannot spread it. To put it another way: organizing massive
            celebrations to be attended by vaccinated (as all highly-vaccinated
            countries have been doing) will get more people vaccinated, but it
            will put the immuno-compromised for which vaccines do not work in
            greater danger. If you want to protect others, sure, getting
            vaccinated is a good idea. Wearing a mask is a good idea if done
            properly. But, most importantly, avoid superspreader events. That is
            far more important than getting vaccinated (if you are worried
            primarily about others), yet alone wearing a mask.<br />
            Makes you wonder whether there is some truth to anti-vaxxers saying
            &quot;<i
              >If Jews were claimed to be the spreaders of typhus in the Third
              Reich, then the unvaccinated are claimed to be the spreaders of
              COVID today.</i
            >&quot;, right? I mean, equating people with an infectious disease
            does not always lead to something much worse. After all, homosexuals
            were equated with an infectious disease during the HIV pandemic, and
            it did not lead to a Holocaust-like genocide of homosexuals. But it
            obviously can lead to something much worse.<br />
            The thing is, when discussing political issues, we need to be
            precise. When we say &quot;<i
              >Vaccines and natural immunity reduce the probability of infection
              and lower the transmission.</i
            >&quot;, do we mean &quot;<i
              >Vaccines lower transmission by around 45% and they decrease the
              probability of infection perhaps by around 13%. And natural
              immunity is even worse than that. Those are effects that are
              easily outweighed by changes in behaviour.</i
            >&quot;? Or do we mean &quot;<i
              >It would be a good idea, at the beginning of the COVID-19
              pandemic, to allow only the people who survived COVID-19 to
              continue working in nursing homes.</i
            >&quot; (which is what Sunetra Gupta was basically saying, and it
            would make sense if natural immunity significantly lowered the
            spread)? Or perhaps we mean, almost equivalently, &quot;<i
              >Vaccine passports can protect immunocompromised people.</i
            >&quot;? If natural immunity and vaccines lowered the spread 10
            times, then Sunetra Gupta's suggestion about relying on natural
            immunity to protect people in nursing homes and the suggestion that
            vaccine passports could help the immunocompromised both make sense.
            If they lower the spread 2 times, as the empirical data shows, then
            those proposals are gibberish, and vaccine passports do little
            except that they set the dangerous precedent of equating people with
            infectious diseases. When we say &quot;<i>Masks work.</i>&quot;, do
            we mean &quot;<i
              >Surgical masks, if worn properly (changed every 15 minutes...),
              perhaps provide around 18% protection from COVID-19.</i
            >&quot; (as the raw data from the Danish Study appears to suggest)?
            Or do we mean &quot;<i
              >A cloth mask will protect me as good as any vaccine.</i
            >&quot; (which would perhaps justify mask mandates)? Those are very
            different things, and have very different implications, even though
            they sound similar.

            <b>Australia-style hotel quarantines are effective.</b><br />
            They aren't. People who work at those hotel quarantines get infected
            all the time. That's presumably because COVID-19 is, although it is
            mostly spread by droplets, also capable of airborne spread, and
            those hotels are not well-ventilated. And, like I have said in my
            previous point, it matters relatively little whether or not you are
            vaccinated when it comes to spreading COVID-19. In fact, statistics
            suggest that no less than one in seven infected travellers in
            Australia caused an outbreak. Thanks to

            for informing me of this. Maybe some high-tech quarantines would be
            effective, it's hard to tell. But quarantines such as those in
            Australia are not. And the quarantines in Ragusan Republic we learn
            in school about as if they were ahead of their time were almost
            certainly ineffective.

              That justifies forced vaccination against COVID-19.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, that is just nonsense, for two reasons:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Viruses that have the ability to shut down the immune system
                before it has a chance to act (as to be resistant to
                vaccination) are incredibly rare. As far as I know, there are
                only three of them: HIV, SIV (a virus closely related to HIV
                existing in monkeys) and Marek's Disease (a cancer-causing virus
                in chicken, distantly related to the chickenpox virus).
              </li>
              <li>
                Even if there is a simple mutation to COVID-19 which would
                enable it to shut down the immune system before it has a chance
                to act (which is, again, incredibly unlikely), everybody being
                vaccinated would select <i>for</i> the strains with that
                mutation, rather than <i>against</i> strains with that mutation.
                Which is what happened with the Marek's Disease in chicken: it
                has evolved the ability to shut down the immune system and thus
                be vaccine-resistant in the last 50 years, pressured into doing
                so by almost all chickens being vaccinated against it. Marek's
                disease would likely evolve into an HIV-like virus even without
                mass vaccination of chicken, but mass vaccination of chicken has
                speeded the process up, rather than slowing it down. If there
                were evidence of COVID-19 getting resistant to vaccination (and
                there is no evidence to match such an extraordinary claim), the
                right thing to do would be to halt the vaccination program,
                rather than try to get everybody vaccinated so that the virus
                would replicate less and there supposedly be fewer variants.
                Similarly, the right thing to do in response to many bacteria
                getting resistant to antibiotics is to stop preventative use of
                antibiotics (in animals, in people infected with flu or
                cold...), rather than force everybody to take antibiotics so
                that those bacteria would procreate less and thus supposedly
                leading to fewer variants.
              </li>
            </ol>
            And I think media saying stuff like that is responsible for the
            current suicide pandemic. Claiming without evidence that COVID-19 is
            likely to evolve to be resistant to vaccination (when, in reality,
            that is a very unlikely nightmare scenario) is irresponsible. And
            claiming we as a society are responsible for that (many people being
            hesitant to getting vaccinated) is also irresponsible. If it were
            happening, it would, if anything, be the fault of people at the wet
            market in Wuhan eating bats who did not receive basic veterinary
            care, rather than the fault of people refusing to get vaccinated.<br />And
            this reminds a lot of the beginning of the HIV pandemic, when,
            during the Reagan administration, media were telling people we were
            all sooner or later going to get infected with HIV (because it is
            supposedly spread by saliva) and that we can postpone that by
            avoiding the homosexuals (that they, for example, should not be
            allowed to eat at restaurants). Why does this pseudoscientific
            apocalyptic fear-mongering that we are all going to get infected
            with an HIV-like virus sell well by the media? Why does advocating
            apartheid using such pseudoscience sell so well by the media? I have
            no idea why people like to read that stuff. I personally get angry
            at people who are writing stuff like that.

            Sorry, but nearly all economists agree they, in the long run, make
            food more expensive by increasing the price of arable land, as well
            as making agricultural machinery more expensive. And even if they do
            not, they are hardly worth the increased taxes, which usually
            disproportionately burden the poor.<br />
            It is amazing that many government programs are such that you cannot
            do a cost-benefit analysis because the benefits are uncertain in a
            way you cannot put the p-value on them (like you can with the
            uncertain things in quantum mechanics). Agriculture subsidies are
            one example. We are supposed to believe (and it is perhaps
            instinctual to believe that) that they make food less expensive, but
            the data paints an entirely different picture. How do you do a
            cost-benefit analysis then? Prisons are also an example of that. We
            are supposed to believe would-be criminals are deterred by the
            prisons, but the data paints an entirely different picture
            (countries with higher incarceration rate being higher in crime,
            rather than lower). How do you do a cost-benefit analysis then?
            Shutting down all non-essential business in the middle of a mass
            hysteria caused by the pandemic is also an example of that. We are
            supposed to believe that will calm the hysteria down and so make the
            pandemic spread less, but the data paints an entirely different
            picture (traffic accidents, as well as epidemiological data, show
            people did not stay home). How do you do a cost-benefit analysis
            then?<br />

              based on the Labour Theory of Value, but I don't think you can
              shoehorn that into some modern economic theory. Milton Friedman
              famously argued agricultural subsidies increase the prices of all
              food up by increasing the price of arable land, and I think just
              about every economist will agree with that. But I have little
              doubt that Franklin Delano Roosevelt honestly believed that the
              agricultural subsidies he introduced were helping.<br />

              >Gun control laws say guns usually used in mass shootings should
              be banned to keep us safe.</b
            ><br />Sorry, but gun control laws generally say exactly the
            opposite. They mostly say that the automated weapons, that are guns
            that may come useful in self-defence when every second counts,
            should be banned, while guns that are generally used in mass
            shootings should remain legal. Why exactly would you need some
            high-tech weapon to commit mass shooting? I understand why you would
            need a high-tech weapon, which can shoot very fast and with high
            precision, to <b>stop</b> a mass shooting: if the weapon you are
            trying to stop the shooting (by injuring the shooter) with is not
            precise, you might harm innocent people while trying to do that. But
            I fail to see how banning high-tech weapons would hurt a mass
            shooter. Do politicians who pass such gun control laws think there
            used to be no mass shootings before automatics and semi-automatics
            were invented, since they think banning them will stop mass
            shootings? Gun control laws are also saying mentally ill people
            ought not to have guns, in spite of the fact that they are the group
            that is most likely to be the victim of violent crime (and people
            with diagnozed mental illnesses are not significiantly more likely
            to be violent criminals, presumably because violent criminals are
            not actually seeking psychiatric help, but are convinced they are
            healthy). Don't take that having a diagnosed mentall illness is not
            a good predictor of being a mass shooter from me, take it from the
            obviously-left-wing website called
            <a
              href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/most-mass-shooters-are-terrorists-not-mentally-ill"
              >Psychiatric Times</a
            >. Once you consider what the gun control laws actually say, it
            seems highly implausible they lead to less crime, does not it?<br />
            And, by the way, at least in Europe, gun ownership is not strongly
            correlated with crime. Serbia and Croatia have significantly more
            guns per capita than the UK does, yet UK has significantly more
            violent crime. Just take a look at the following infographic (which
            was recently circulating the Croatian media):<br />
            <img
              style="max-width: 100%; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px"
              src="https://www.croatiaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Safety-walking-alone-at-night-by-country.png"
            /><br />
            Countries in Europe with the least stringent gun laws are Serbia and
            Switzerland (well, the gun laws there are widely different, but are
            nevertheless not strict), and the country with strictest gun laws is
            the UK (where even some types of knives are illegal so that they
            cannot be used in crime). Does it look like the statistics show you
            can ban your way to safety? To me it doesn't. Adjusting for other
            factors? Well, adjusting for other factors makes it look even more
            like gun control isn't working, as the biggest factor is GDP per
            capita, and the UK has a much higher GDP per capita than Croatia
            does. But let's say (against the evidence) gun ownership and violent
            crime are positively correlated. Would that mean that law-abiding
            citizens owning firearms somehow causes areas to be higher in
            violent crime? Like one person on an Internet forum explained to me:
            &quot;<i
              >My friend, if you were forced to live in a high-crime area,
              wouldn't you want to get a gun to protect yourself?</i
            >&quot;.
            <br />
            While this isn't strongly a fact, only my opinion, I think that
            people are being very inconsistent when they think about gun control
            because they do not apply it to governments. Almost everybody thinks
            that people with a history of crime should not have access to guns.
            Yet, at the same time, almost everybody thinks governments should
            have militaries. However, almost any country has a track record of
            mass murder. The USA has that War on Terror (which mostly kills
            people for which there is no good reason to think they are
            terrorists), China has Cultural Revolution (which was basically a
            mass murder of the intellectuals), Croatia has Jasenovac and
            Bleiburg (I suspect most people think those things happened too long
            ago so they are no longer relevant, but I do not buy into that
            apologetic), Serbia has Bosnian Genocide of the 1990s (and the
            Croatian government probably cannot be said to be completely
            innocent there either)... If having used illegal drugs is a proof
            you are too dangerous to own a gun, then recent history is a proof
            that almost every government is too dangerous to have a military or
            an armed police, don't you think? That's not to say all governments
            are equal, far from it. The war crimes committed against Bosnians by
            a Croatian paramilitary led by Slobodan Praljak or the Varivode
            Massacre in which tens of elderly Serbian civilians were killed by
            the Croatian military are both nothing compared to the tens of
            thousands of killed by Serbian government in the Bosnian genocide.
            But being less of the two evils is not a justification for having
            weapons, is it?<br />
            Also, even if gun control laws were indeed banning the weapons which
            are usually used in mass shootings, would that be a good idea? Let's
            apply that logic elsewhere. If some type of car was
            disproportionately common in traffic accidents, would it be a good
            idea to punish everybody who happens to own that type of car? Of
            course not.<br />
            And even if a diagnosed mental illness were a good predictor of
            being a mass shooter (which it is not), would making it illegal for
            people with a diagnosed mental illness to own guns be a good idea?
            Don't you think it can easily backfire? It is making gun owners
            afraid of seeking psychiatric help, isn't it? Once again, the policy
            almost everybody seems to agree on (preventing mentally ill people
            from owning firearms) makes the least sense.<br />
            And if you think &quot;<i>natural experiments</i>&quot; prove that
            gun control works, make sure you've read
            <a
              href="https://flatassembler.github.io/pseudosciences.html#statistics"
              >the end of the paragraph about misunderstanding the statistics on
              the Pseudosciences page on this website</a
            >.<br />
            But I think gun control is a good example of how irrational people
            are when they think about politics. It's obvious that the vast
            majority of people are thinking either &quot;<i
              >I am a Democrat, I guess I should support gun control, therefore
              I believe gun control is good.</i
            >&quot; or &quot;<i
              >I am a Republican, I guess I should not support gun control,
              therefore I think gun control is bad.</i
            >&quot;. I once started a discussion about gun control on an
            Internet forum and, whenever I brought up the Gary Kleck's study,
            the first response from most of the people in the debate was
            &quot;<i>I have never heard of it.</i>&quot;. It seems to me that
            almost nobody is thinking &quot;<i
              >I have researched gun control and I think it will have good
              consequences, so I support it.</i
            >&quot; or &quot;<i
              >I have researched gun control and I think it will have bad
              consequences, so I oppose it.</i
            >&quot;. In my opinion, that type of thinking is equivalent of being
            a Flat-Earther without being familiar with the Aristotle's three
            arguments for the Earth being round. If we should insult
            Flat-Earthers, shouldn't we also insult people who think about
            politics that way? At least, when I was a Flat-Earther, I was
            familiar with the Aristotle's three arguments for the Earth being
            round (ships disappearing bottom first, shifting constellations, and
            the Earth's shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse always being
            circular), I just thought they were seriously flawed (that waves are
            the simplest explanation for ships disappearing bottom first, that
            shifting constellations can simply be explained by the stars being
            only 3'100 miles up in the sky, and that there is no reason to think
            the shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is the Earth's
            shadow). Most of the people who have a strong opinion on gun control
            appear to think about politics less rationally than I was thinking
            about the shape of the Earth. And that way of thinking is dangerous
            when applied to politics. Can you answer the following questions:
            The guy who started the academic discussion about gun control was
            Gary Kleck. What were the main consclusions of his study? What are
            the (supposed or real) flaws with his study that proponents of gun
            control point out? If you will have a strong opinion about gun
            control, you should at least be able to answer those questions. I
            have looked into it, and I am having a hard time explaining why the
            Gary Kleck's study would be pseudoscience without implying that not
            only

            <b>Boycotting sweatshops is good.</b><br />This is believed by both
            left-wing (that sweatshops should be banned domestically) and
            right-wing (that we should add barriers to stifle trading with them,
            and that we are protecting illegal immigrants by deporting them out
            of the country so that they will not work jobs which legal
            immigrants and citizens are not willing to do; That is what the
            slogan &quot;<i>Open borders are not compassionate.</i>&quot;
            means.) politicians, but by almost no economist. Boycotting
            sweatshops leads to people being employed there get some other job
            available to them, which are usually worse. People are usually in
            sweatshops because they consider alternatives to be even worse, and
            they are probably right about that (they certainly have more insight
            into the situation of their country than we do).<br />
            Which brings me to a related point. Many people are saying stuff
            like &quot;<i
              >Be the part of the change you want to see in the world.
              Capitalism allows us to address global problems by being careful
              about which products we buy.</i
            >&quot;. But the truth is, many (probably the vast majority of them)
            people who try to address global problems by being conscientious
            customers are doing ineffective or even counter-productive things,
            because they understand the problems they want to address poorly.
            Countless people are worried about the working conditions in the
            developing countries and are boycotting sweatshops because of that,
            even though it is difficult to imagine how that could do anything
            but make things worse. I don't think there is anything you and I can
            do about the working conditions in developing countries. Many
            people, including me a few years ago, are worried about
            superbacteria, and they stop eating meat... But they continue eating
            eggs. That basically has no effect, as way more antibiotics are used
            in the egg industry than in the meat industry. Many people,
            including me a few years ago, are worried about global warming, and
            they stop drinking cow's milk... But they start drinking the
            cheapest of the plant milks, which is the rice milk. Production of
            rice milk also emits a lot of methane. And so on...

                Nearly all climate models suggest CO<sub>2</sub> is far more
                important in global warming than methane is, for the simple
                reason that the spectre of methane is similar to that of water.
                Water is the most potent and the most abundant greenhouse gas in
                the atmosphere, so the spectres of greenhouse gases themselves
                don't matter, what matters is their difference from the spectre
                of water.<br />

                Methane emissions are not increasing, in fact, they reached
                their peak somewhere in the 1980s:<br />
                <img

                /><br />The derivative of that curve (the speed at which it
                moves upwards) is approximately equal to our methane emissions.
                That's because it's an example of what we call in our Control
                Engineering classes &quot;IT<sub>1</sub> system&quot; (the T<sub
                  >1</sub

                  derive a transfer function for it, and it seems to me that it
                  is

                  />, 12 being the half-life of methane in the atmosphere
                  measured in years. That doesn't look like IT<sub>1</sub>. But,
                  in any case, I'd expect that our methane emissions are
                  approximately equal to the derivative of that curve.</i

              <li>
                What exactly should be done? As far as I understand it, most
                scientists agree our methane emissions mostly come from
                grass-fed cows, which emit far more methane than grain-fed cows.
                As such, the most effective way of decreasing our methane
                emissions would be more factory farming. But that is wrong
                because of both the animal welfare and factory farming being the
                biggest cause of antibiotic resistance. I don't know about you,
                but I'd much rather let the Earth get slightly warmer than to
                have yet another pandemic, this time of an antibiotic-resistant
                bacteria.
              </li>
            </ol>
            So, I don't know about you, but I am glad little or nothing is being
            done about our methane emissions. Because anything we can do will
            either have no effect while being expensive (reducing methane
            consumption, it is misled given that much more methane comes from
            grass-fed cows), or will be dangerous as in leading to pandemics of
            antibiotic resistant bacteria (having fewer grass-fed and more
            grain-fed cows).<br />It is also amazing to me how politicians react
            to the problem of global warming. On one hand, they blow it up
            beyond any proportions (as it is certainly less of a threat than
            bacteria resistant to antibiotics are, but you would struggle to
            know that if you listen to the mainstream media), and, on the other
            hand, they refuse to do anything sensible about it. For example,
            just about any form of energy is being heavily subsidized, except
            the cleanest one that is nuclear energy.<br />My best guess as to
            why global warming is considered more of a threat than a pandemic
            is, is that, up until late 2019, there was this idea in almost
            everyone's minds that a pandemic could be easily contained. That
            idea probably won't be true even in a perfect world in which
            everybody was rational (What is an appropriate response to an
            alleged but unproven pandemic, which is how all pandemics start?),
            much less is in this world.

            Golden Age Fallacy. It is generally agreed that scurvy was a major
            cause of death in the Middle Ages. Furthermore, before the

            strongly linked to kidney stones. People simply used to eat a diet
            causing different problems, not a healthier diet.

        I think this was enough examples to see how mainstream political

        perhaps just as much as Neo-Nazism is. Quite often, they are also

            While you can plausibly claim one of those, you cannot claim both.
            In fact, based on the evidence that I have seen, I would say
            omega-3-acids have no effect whatsoever on heart disease (except
            possibly indirectly by reducing type-2-diabetes), so both of those
            claims are false.

            Obviously, you do not get to claim both, because, with nuclear
            energy, there is at least a possibility there will not be a
            catastrophy, whereas, without it, global warming will certainly lead
            to one. And the evidence strongly suggests both of them are false.
            Modern nuclear plants are very safe, and global warming is certainly
            less of a threat than pandemics are.

        Mainstream politics, including the education system, often makes people
        think some things are uncontroversial, when they are in fact very

              >Type-2-diabetes could be almost completely eliminated if the
              government made people follow the right diet.</b
            ><br />While animal studies leave us with little doubt that too much
            fructose (one of the main parts of sugar, the other one being
            glucose) can cause type-2-diabetes, and they also leave us with
            basically no doubt that too much saturated fat can cause
            type-2-diabetes, it is not clear that any of that plays a role in
            the modern type-2-diabetes pandemic. First of all, it is not
            entirely clear how exactly saturated fats apparently cause
            type-2-diabetes. Is there some complicated biological mechanism by
            which saturated fats lead to insulin resistance? Or is it the other
            way around: maybe it is the unsaturated fats such as omega-3-acids
            amplifying the effect of insulin by some complicated biological
            mechanism, protecting against type-2-diabetes, and too much
            saturated fat causing type-2-diabetes indirectly via a lack of
            omega-3-acids. Or is it a combination of both? We cannot pretend we
            understand those things, much less that we understand it well enough
            to solve the problem. Second, epidemiological studies that control
            for body mass generally find no association between sugar and
            type-2-diabetes, and some even find a negative association. That
            suggests that a lot more sugar than people, including those who
            happen to get type-2-diabetes, usually eat is needed for that effect
            of sugar causing type-2-diabetes to show up in humans. The
            association between saturated fat and type-2-diabetes is a bit
            better supported by the evidence, but there are still many studies
            that find no effect and a few studies that find a negative
            association. Again, a lot more saturated fat than people, including
            those who happen to get type-2-diabetes, usually eat is needed in
            humans for that effect to show up. The evidence that saturated fat
            is partly responsible for the current pandemic of heart disease is
            far better. Let's face it: we don't understand why some people
            develop type-2-diabetes and others do not. The government cannot
            solve a problem which it does not understand. Not to mention
            pretending we know type-2-diabetes is caused by diet is insulting
            victim-blaming.

            While migration obviously enables the spread of harmful germs, it
            also enables the spread of dead harmful germs and innocent germs
            closely related to the harmful germs, both of which basically work
            as natural vaccines. So, it is hard to tell whether the effect of

                If not for the government regulation, many ISPs would probably
                set up their DNS servers to respond to requests from all IP
                addresses (rather than just the IP addresses of the users they

                IP addresses as if their DNS requests come from the IP of the
                server they are attacking, flooding the server they are
                attacking with DNS responses to queries it did not actually
                make. Hackers would need to use very little bandwidth for that,
                since they could massively amplify their attacks using
                improperly set up DNS servers of various ISPs. (I have asked

                HTTPS, rather than unencrypted DNS. That will slightly slow down
                the Internet, but would make both the DDOS attacks utilizing DNS
                for amplification (as you cannot make DNS-over-HTTPS requests
                while spoofing your IP address) and spying which websites you
                visit using DNS impossible. Why should it be that web hosting
                services should have to have some anti-DDOS defences and that it
                is possible to track what people are doing on-line just because
                the ISPs are using legacy technology? But ISPs are lobbying
                against DNS over HTTPS due to the supposed
                &quot;<i>security</i>&quot; reasons (total nonsense, of course).

                >
                In many factories, there are electrical machines that rely on
                the alternating current they receive to be in the form of a
                perfect sine wave, without high-frequency noise (High-frequency
                noise can destroy sensitive electrical equipment by causing
                unexpected resonances.). If the government regulation wasn't
                guaranteeing that the electricity people receive is high-quality
                (without high-frequency noise)... Well, those machines at
                factories would have to be engineered not only to do the things
                they are supposed to do, but also to be immune to low-quality
                electricity. They would be even more expensive than they are
                today, perhaps much more. Now, you might argue that the
                governments are going too far. Perhaps the electricity that goes
                to homes shouldn't be held to as high standards as the
                electricity that is going to factories. After all, electrical
                devices you have at home generally respond to low-quality
                electricity by their timers being slightly off. Maybe the
                regulations is making the home electricity more expensive for no
                good reason (Though I have heard experts convincingly argue that
                overregulation is not the reason electricity is so expensive, so
                it is hard to tell.). But low-quality electricity destroying
                expensive electric equipment is a real problem and government
                regulation addresses it.

            So, are those problems solved by democracy? I am quite sure an

        Another thing to note is that narrative changes in mainstream media have
        little or nothing to do with what is happening in the real world. 50
        years ago, had you suggested saturated fat did not cause heart disease
        or sugar did not cause type-2-diabetes, you would be considered insane.
        Today, bestseller books and documentaries watched by countless people
        are claiming such things. But there is nothing in science that caused
        such a change. While high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol) was
        discovered and it is possible (but far from proven) it protects against
        heart attacks, the suggestion that a small increase in HDL done by
        saturated fat somehow offsets the huge increase of LDL (low-density
        lipoprotein, which we know causes heart disease as they are pills that
        treat heart disease by lowering it, among others, statins) they do seems
        ridiculous. The suggestion that fructose in sugar does not cause
        type-2-diabetes is, if anything, more absurd now than it was 50 years
        ago. And the <i>discussion</i> in the mainstream media about whether
        fructose can cause type-2-diabetes blinds people to what might be the
        real cause of the current type-2-diabetes pandemic, such as perhaps the
        lack of omega-3-acids (that possibility is, for a reason that escapes
        me, almost never mentioned in the mainstream media). Similarly with
        masks: at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mainstream media,
        including Anthony Fauci, was suggesting that mask wearing by general
        population may even be counter-productive, while, today, saying that is
        considered a heresy. Mainstream media would make you think there were
        countless new studies suggesting masks work. But that is definitely not
        how it happened. The danger of nuclear weapons being fired accidentally
        was a normal thing to discuss during the Cold War, while, today,
        suggesting that is considered weird. In reality, the danger is even
        greater now than it was during the Cold War.<br />
        Furthermore, what's getting normalized by the society has little to do
        with what actually makes sense. For instance, vegetarianism as a way to
        fight superbacteria is getting normalized: nobody would call you insane
        for being a vegetarian. But demanding that the eggs you eat are
        antibiotic-free, or avoiding eating eggs altogether, which empirically
        makes far more sense than being a vegetarian (as around 70% of
        antibiotics are used in the egg industry, and less than 5% is used in
        the beef industry), is considered weird.<br />
        Another way politics blinds people is by making <i>everything</i> a
        politically sensitive issue, which is therefore difficult to discuss and
        think about. For example, in the USA, the method with which to teach
        reading is being politicized. Phonics, the method used in most countries
        around the world (including Croatia), and which involves explicit
        teaching of letter-to-sound correspondences, is associated with the
        political right. Whole language theory, on the other hand, is a method
        which encourages guessing based on the context, is associated with the
        political left. Now, how it became a matter of politics rather than
        applied linguistics is anybody's guess. But what's not controversial is
        that politicis makes it difficult to be objective and honestly discuss
        those things. Or whether Ivermectin is safe and effective to treat
        COVID-19. Right-wing answer is yes, left-wing answer is no. Difficult to
        be objective and discuss that, right?<br />
        That is why you should not listen only to the mainstream media, but try
        to get a deeper insight into political issues. If you listen only to the
        mainstream media, you will be duped into believing false and sometimes
        even incoherent things. I hope I am helping you with getting a deeper
        insight into political issues.<br /><br />
