        In recent years, many people have been calling themselves libertarian,
        even though that's not at all what they mean. The anti-vaccine activist
        Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls himself a libertarian, but he is arguably
        for increasing the government regulation, rather than decreasing it.

        The vast majority of the laws we have are unnecessary or even harmful.
        The USA has over 80'000 pages of federal regulation, and that arguably
        stifles small businesses, and is mostly not the reason why we are living
        in such a good time. The reason cars aren't randomly catching fire any
        more like they did in the early 20th century is because of the
        advancements in engineering, and those had little or nothing to do with
        the regulations pushed after the Ford Pinto. The reason why vaccines
        today don't cause anything like the Cutter Vaccine Incident in the 1950s
        is because today we are using RNA vaccines, which cannot cause an
        infection even in theory, rather than because of the government
        regulation. The regulation should arguably be massively reduced compared
        to the status quo. And the government, when trying to solve complicated
        societal problems, is mostly in the position of medieval physicians:
        politicians have some pre-scientific notions of how society works and
        are proposing cures based on that, and almost every cure they are
        proposing for complicated problems turns out to either be ineffective or
        counter-productive, for the same reason as medieval medicine was just as
        likely to harm its patients as it was to help them. The government
        should simply stop trying to solve complicated societal problems until
        social sciences advance to a lot higher point than they are now. As
        well, governments have in recent history killed way more people than
        murderers did. Hitler alone probably killed more people than all the
        individual murderers in the 20th century, and that's not counting all
        the other mass murderers in the 20th century.<br />
        What is the best way of spreading this message? I wish I knew the
        answer. But I have a lot of experience with it and I know what not to
        do:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Don't use laws against murder as examples of good laws.</b><br />
            Ask yourself, what are we accomplishing by punishing murderers?
            Because that's what laws against murder do, they don't prevent
            murder, they punish it. The police only comes after a psychopath has
            already murdered somebody, and then they put that psychopath in a
            prison or a jail. A prison or a jail is not a place from he will
            return sane, it's a place from which he will return with even more
            psychological problems. It's obvious how laws against murder might
            be making things worse, and it's not at all obvious how they might
            be making things any better.<br />
            Doesn't it seem way more probable to you that actually good laws are
            laws against the misuse of antibiotics in the egg industry, or the
            laws against open DNS servers? Laws which are supposed to prevent
            superbacteria or the Internet being paralyzed by DNS reflection
            attacks are at least ante-hoc rather than post-hoc.<br />
            When trying to address the problem of violent crime, <b>then</b> we
            are in the position of medieval physicians, much more so than when
            we are trying to address the problem of superbacteria or open DNS
            servers.<br />
            You know, when it comes to policies such as death penalty or gun
            control, I can at least understand the other side. I understand how
            somebody can think that putting some murderers to death (those that
            are most likely to fall into recidivism) will probably save more
            people than it kills, and that therefore death penalty works to save
            lives. I can understand how somebody can think that the studies
            supposedly showing a large number of defensive gun uses (Gary Kleck
            and Marc Gertz 1995 study...) suffer from massive errors due to
            telescoping and similar biases, and that therefore gun control is
            likely to help. But I cannot understand how somebody can think laws
            against murder work to decrease murder.

              >Don't say or imply that superbacteria are a very temporary
              problem and that lab-grown animal products will soon solve that
              problem.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's not remotely true. It's true
            that 80% of antibiotics are being used for farm animals, but that
            doesn't mean lab-grown animal products will soon solve that problem.
            Namely, most of those antibiotics are being used in the egg
            industry. It's hard to tell the exact percentage, but you need to
            take into account that 45% of all antibiotics we use today are
            ionophores, which are antibiotics effective in birds but not in
            mammals. We will not have lab-grown eggs any time soon. We struggle
            to even produce lab-grown muscle meat, and eggs are far more
            complicated than muscles. That's why I think dealing with
            superbacteria is a legitimate role of the government.<br />
            We should absolutely be looking for technical solutions to such
            problems, to replace the political solutions. But what when the
            problem is serious (superbacteria is arguably a more serious problem
            than global warming), there is a political solution that works
            already, and the technological solution is very far away? In that
            case, government action is justified.<br />
            This is entirely different from global warming. Global warming is a
            less serious problem than superbacteria, and, more importantly, it
            is not at all obvious what the government should do about it. Punish
            companies which sell cheap fossil fuels and thereby enable poor
            people access to energy to heat their homes? Does not sound like a
            good idea, does it? That is why global warming is not a good
            justification for government actions, while superbacteria is.

              on sane government regulation to work.</b
            ><br />
            What do you think would happen if there was no law requiring the
            ISPs that, if they set up an unencrypted DNS server, they make it
            respond only to the requests from the IP addresses it is supposed to
            serve, rather than to all IP addresses? The answer seems obvious to
            me (as a computer engineer): some ISPs would set up their DNS
            servers improperly, and that would make it trivial for the hackers
            to paralyze the Internet with denial-of-service attacks. DNS servers
            sometimes respond with long responses to short queries, so all the
            hackers would need to do to paralyze the Internet in an anarchy is
            to spoof their IP address and make such
            short-but-long-response-causing DNS requests. That's called DNS
            reflection attack.<br />
            And in case you think this is a very temporary problem, that
            Internet will soon naturally switch to DNS-over-HTTPS (and it is by
            no means obvious that would happen in a libertarian society -- ISPs
            are lobbying against DNS-over-HTTPS because DNS-over-HTTPS makes it
            harder for them to collect the user data for sale), I'm sorry to
            burst your bubble, but the Internet of the near future will be even
            more vulnerable to such attacks, rather than less. HTTP 3 and other
            QUIC-based services are not TCP-based, they are UDP-based, so there
            are no TCP handshakes inherent in them. They have their methods to
            prevent IP-spoofing attacks, but those take more processing time to
            implement. In an anarchy, what would force the web-hosting companies
            (Hostinger...) that, if they implement HTTP 3 or other QUIC-based
            services, they implement them properly (check whether the handshake
            was properly done, check that the session has not expired...)? If
            they are not implemented properly, the Internet is vulnerable to
            DNS-reflection-like attacks on steroids. I say &quot;on
            steroids&quot; because DNS can only respond with 4 UDP packets to
            one UDP packet, but HTTP 3 can respond with a lot longer
            responses.<br />
            That's why I think making the Internet work with basic regulation is
            a legitimate role of the government.

            <b
              >Don't say or imply that COVID lockdowns are the
              <i>main</i> reason for the current mental health crisis.</b
            ><br />
            Sorry, that goes against the data about as much as the common saying
            that timely-implemented lockdowns saved millions of lives in Europe
            in 2020 goes against the data. Lockdowns and suicides are not
            correlated, just like non-pharmaceutical interventions aren't
            negatively correlated with COVID deaths. In fact, the country that
            had the highest rise in suicides in 2020, that is Japan, did not
            have a lockdown.<br />
            Also, don't you think anti-vaxxers are destroying peoples' mental
            health? To me it seems undeniable that they do. They are saying
            stuff like &quot;<i
              >RNA vaccines are causing subclinical myocarditis in 3% of the
              people who take them (and, of course, COVID causes it even more
              often then). A significant percentage of population is going to
              die young because of heart attacks.</i
            >&quot;. Even if you yourself do not believe the things they say,
            reading such things again and again is going to damage your mental
            health, don't you agree? If I wanted to cause suicides in as many
            people as possible, I couldn't think of a better strategy than doing
            what the anti-vaxxers are doing these days.

              that factory farming saved us from global warming.</b
            ><br />
            That's both an evil belief and a false belief. It's evil because it
            is assuming that torturing animals in factory farms is necessary or
            at least beneficial. And it is false because the statistics
            supposedly showing that our methane emissions reached their peak in
            the 1980s and have been decreasing ever since are simply wrong
            analyses of the data. They are implicitly assuming methane
            concentrations in the atmosphere are an IT<sub>1</sub>-type system
            with respect to our methane emissions, which it is not. It is an
            exponential decay system. And this diagram:<br />

              "
            /><br />
            This diagram is almost exactly what we would expect if our methane
            emissions were constant. Here is what our methane emissions might
            have been, based on a computer simulation:<br />

            /><br />
            No discernable trend, right? And this commonly-cited statistic that
            grass-fed cows emit around 3 times as much methane per a litre of
            milk as grain-fed cows is probably wildly wrong for two reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Cows emit methane when digesting starch, not only when digesting
                cellulose. They emit less methane when digesting starch, but far
                from none.
              </li>
              <li>
                Methanotrophic bacteria on pastures capture a fair amount of
                methane from grass-fed cows before it goes up into the
                atmosphere.
              </li>
            </ul>
            You can read more about that problem on
            <a href="factory_farming#second_argument"
              >my blog-post about factory farming counter-apologetics</a

              Economic Calculation Problem.</b
            ><br />
            Or, if you are going to claim that, make sure you have an
            explanation as to how it could work informatically. Economic
            Calculation Problem is essentially saying &quot;<i
              >In socialism, which algorithm might a government use to
              approximate the optimal prices of goods and services in a
              centralized manner?</i
            >&quot;, the implication being &quot;<i
              >There cannot be such an algorithm.</i
            >&quot;. But isn't that the equivalent of saying: &quot;<i
              >Optimal prices of goods and serivices can only be approximated by
              an algorithm which can be implemented in a multi-threaded way, but
              it cannot be implemented in a single-threaded way.</i
            >&quot;? Doesn't that seem to contradict much of informatics?
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't claim that democracy is the primary reason governments
              solve problems.</b
            ><br />
            That seems to be very disconnected from the reality. Governments
            appear to excell at solving problems a common person doesn't
            understand well, not the problems people understand and are willing
            to vote for them getting solved. For example, just about any
            government around the world has laws against the misuse of
            antibiotics in the egg industry, even though an average person has
            little or no understanding of the problem of superbacteria (Hardly
            anybody realizes most antibiotics are being used in the egg
            industry.). And just about every government around the world has
            laws against open DNS servers, even though an average person doesn't
            understand how the Internet works well enough to understand why
            those laws are necessary. As a side note, engineers seem to somehow
            realize that. Almost no engineer is afraid of the widespread
            deployment of HTTP 3 and other QUIC-based services because
            improperly implemented QUIC servers (which do not check whether the
            handshake has been done properly or whether the session has expired)
            can be used by hackers to implement DNS-reflection-like attacks on
            steroids. Every engineer seems to understand that governments will
            make sure that doesn't happen.<br />
            Also, don't you think there is a lot of truth to what Keynes said:
            &quot;<i
              >Sensible economic policies are unlikely to be followed in a
              democratic society.</i
            >&quot;? I mean, think about it, almost all democratic societies
            have policies such as the minimum wage, which no economic theory
            suggests are good policies (And in case you are under any delusion
            the Keynesian economics says that minimum wage is a good policy,
            here is a refutation of that claim: &quot;<i
              >Keynesian economics is explaining the fact that unemployment
              tends to rise during economic booms as being the result of prices
              falling down faster than wages. In other words, that wages are
              sticky. Try to explain why a sticky wage would cause unemployment
              without implying that a government-mandated minimum wage also
              will! You cannot, right?</i
            >&quot;.). Democratic governments are, instead of trying to make the
            economy cool down during economic booms so that economic busts won't
            be as severe, mostly doing the opposite of that: they are setting
            low interest rates during the booms. Democracies implement policies
            which sell to voters, not policies which actually make sense.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't say &quot;<i
                >Capitalism doesn't need government regulation because it allows
                us to address global problems by collectively being
                conscientious customers.</i
              >&quot;.</b
            ><br />
            Now, this is, I think, a perfect example of a claim that's true in
            theory but is nonsense is praxis. In theory, yes, capitalism does
            allow us to address global problems by being conscientious
            customers, certainly much more so than communism does. However, in
            praxis, I think it doesn't work for two reasons:
            <ol>
              <li>
                People tend to be not only <b>un</b>informed about global
                problems, but also <b>mis</b>informed about them, and are doing
                ineffective or even counter-productive things in an attempt to
                address global problems. Some examples:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Many people are worried about the working conditions in the
                    developing countries, so they respond by boycotting
                    sweatshops. It's difficult to see how boycotting sweatshops
                    might do anything but make things worse. People are in
                    sweatshops because they think the alternatives available to
                    them are even worse, and they are probably right about that.
                    They certainly have more insight into the situation in their
                    country than we do.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many people are worried about superbacteria, so they stop
                    eating meat... but they continue buying eggs from factory
                    farms. Sorry, that's not helping, for reasons I explained
                    above.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many people are worried about methane emissions, so they
                    stop drinking cow's milk... to replace it with the cheapest
                    of the plant milks which is rice milk. Whether that's
                    helping at all is hard to tell, and it's certainly not
                    helping significantly. Production of rice also emits a lot
                    of methane. Oat milk is much better when it comes to methane
                    emissions, but it's also more expensive.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                It's difficult to imagine people would be less misinformed in an
                anarchy. The education system is already full of propaganda by

                One can only imagine how bad it would be in an anarchy.<br />
                Governments are better at understanding global problems than
                individuals are because governments are, well, bunch of
                individuals debating on how to address global problems.
              </li>
              <li>
                Even if we assume the first problem would be solved, what about
                the problems such as open DNS servers? How would people address
                it? People stopping eating eggs to stop superbacteria wouldn't
                have horrifying economic consequences, people stopping using the
                Internet to address the problem of open DNS servers would.
              </li>
            </ol>
            So, I think that one who is using this argument with capitalism not
            needing government should stop thinking and start looking. In other
            words, touch the grass.<br />
            That's not to say we shouldn't be conscientious customers. I think
            we absolutely should give up eggs, and probably meat, and perhaps
            milk as well. But we should acknowledge that governments are doing
            way more to address the problem of superbacteria than we are doing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        A good deal of those can be refuted with &quot;<i
          >Let's think about how good we are having it these days.</i
        >&quot;. We are living in a world in which almost everybody eats eggs,
        but we are not having pandemics of superbacteria every now and then.
        Why? Sane government regulation, of course. We are living in a world
        with countless ISPs with their own DNS servers, yet the Internet isn't
        paralyzed by denial-of-service attacks made possible by some ISPs
        incorrectly setting up their DNS servers. Why? Sane government
        regulation, of course. As much as it is important to improve the world
        by removing nonsensible or even harmful laws, it is also important not
        to lose what we have.<br />
        And it's not at all obvious how libertarianism should be implemented.
        The fact is that we have tens of thousands of pages of regulation, the
        vast majority of them being unnecessary or downright harmful, but an
        average person isn't capable of telling which ones are necessary. Most
        of the people are operating under the assumption that the Hobbesian
        nonsense about &quot;<i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>&quot;, that
        government has some huge positive effect on violent crime, is true.
        That's why they think the laws against murder are necessary, even if a
        little bit of thinking makes it seem at least probable that they are
        unnecessary. As well, plenty of people are under the impression that the
        reason why cars aren't randomly catching fire any more like they did in
        the early 20th century is because of the regulations passed in response
        to Ford Pinto, or that the reason why COVID vaccines didn't cause
        anything like the Cutter Vaccine Incident is because of the regulation
        passed after the Cutter Vaccine Incident. That's very disconnected from
        the reality, the actual reasons are advancemens in engineering, which
        had little or nothing to do with the government regulation. The reason
        cars aren't randomly catching fire any more like Ford Pinto did is
        because mechanical engineering has advanced a lot since then, and the
        actual reason why we didn't have another Cutter Vaccine Incident while
        rushing with the COVID vaccines is because today we are using RNA
        vaccines, which cannot spread the disease they are supposed to protect
        against even in theory. But I am not sure an average person is capable
        of seeing that. An average person is quite likely to think that the
        regulations passed after Ford Pinto or the Cutter Vaccine Incident are
        good regulations. On the other hand, an average person has little or no
        understanding of global problems such as superbacteria, to understand,
        for example, why laws against the misuse of antibiotics in the egg
        industry are necessary. And an average person doesn't understand how the
        Internet works well enough to understand why laws against open DNS
        servers and laws against improperly configured QUIC servers (not
        checking whether the handshake has been done properly or whether the
        session has expired) are necessary. Anarcho-capitalism provides some way
        of enforcing the laws against murder (with private security companies),
        but it doesn't appear to provide a way of enforcing what seem to me to
        actually be good laws, such as laws against the misuse of antibiotics in
        the egg industry. That's why anarcho-capitalism is a wrong answer.
        Congress voting on each legislation as to whether it is necessary? Well,
        that's slightly better than anarcho-capitalism, but I am not sure that
        would work as, like I've said, an average person has a wildly mistaken
        notion on which laws are necessary, and politicians cannot be expected
        to be a lot better. I've written
        <a
          href="https://teo-samarzija.users.sourceforge.net/how-not-to-reach-libertarianism.doc"
          >a short story in Croatian about the dangers I see in attempts to do
          massive deregulation, like the ones proposed by Michael Huemer</a
        >. Arming the civilians so that the government is afraid to push
        nonsensible laws? Well, I suppose that works somewhat, but even that can
        turn incredibly counter-productive: if more people had been armed during
        the Four Pests Campaign, chances are, more birds would be killed, and
        the Great Chinese Famine would have thereby been even worse (because the
        invasion of locusts would be worse). The world is complicated, and any
        simplistic solution is unlikely to work.
