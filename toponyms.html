            <br/>Toponyms are often affected by the linguistic phenomenon called tautology.
            A toponym is often composed of more words in different languages meaning exactly the same.
            A famous example of that is <i>Torpenhow Hill</i>.<br>
            <br>
            One of the most confusing things about the language of Voynich Manuscript is that it has huge entropy of phonotactics.
            Its first-order entropy appears to be remarkably similar to Hebrew, but its second-order entropy is even lower than that of Hawaiian language.
	    This has led some people to speculate that the letters within words in the Voynich Manuscript were rearranged according to some rules.<br/>(That is slightly relevant here, because of <a href="#english_summary">this</a>.)

		<b>SUMMARY</b>: It will be argued that it is impossible that the Illyrian language died out in ancient times, as the mainstream historical linguistics claims, but that it is nearly certain that it, despite never being attested, died relatively recently and that many, if not most of the, Croatian toponyms come from it. The main argument for that is that, if the toponyms came from the Croatian language, most of them would make sense to those who speak Croatian, yet the vast majority of them don't. Alternative etymologies are proposed for around 100 toponyms in or on the borders of Croatia. Some basic vocabulary of Illyrian is reconstructed, the most certain words are: *issa~iasa, meaning "source of a health-giving water", presumably coming from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/i̯es.htm">root</a> meaning "boiling" or "spring", *karr~kurr, meaning "to flow", presumably from a Pre-Indo-European substrate language and cognate to the Late Latin fish names "carpa" and "carassius" (<i>UPDATE on 12/01/2024: I've asked a <a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/q/23119/8533">StackExchange question about the possibility that "carpa" and "carassius" come from the Illyrian word for "to flow"</a>.</i>), *kull~kl meaning "mountain", presumably from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/kel-1_kelə.htm">root</a> meaning "high", *mar~mur, meaning "marsh", almost certainly from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/mori_mōri.htm">root</a> meaning "marsh" or "sea", *api, meaning "water", from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/ā̆p-2.htm">root</a> meaning "body of water", the word *pis~pik meaning "coniferous forest", almost certainly <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/pei̯_ə_-_pī̆.htm">related</a> to the Latin word "pix" (resin), and the word *melit~malit, meaning "sea island", probably of Pre-Indo-European origin. The evidence for the root <i>*karr~kurr</i> is considered by the author to be the most firm, since the pattern of it appearing in Croatian river names has a p-value of at most around <del>1/500</del> 5.9% (see the <a href="#correction">correction</a> for more details). The evidence is consistent enough that some grammatical features of Illyrian can also be inferred, such as the /a/~/u/ ablaut. My conclusion is that Illyrian was a centum Indo-European language with some specific sound changes, such as *b<sup>h</sup> turning to /p/ in some conditions (perhaps only before 'a') and into /β/ (voiced bilabial fricative) in others, *k<sup>j</sup> turning to /j/ (the semi-vowel) in front of a nasal, *g<sup>j</sup> turning into /x/ (velar fricative) in at least some conditions, *k<sup>w</sup> turning into /k/, single consonants being geminated after a short vowel (presumably because all the syllables had to be of equal length), the diphthongs *ew and *ey monophthongized into long /i/, syllabic consonants turning into /i+C/, the initial laryngeals being preserved as /e/ (presumably because of a word-initial accent), in the later stages of Illyrian (when Illyrian names and words were attested in historical documents), 'e' turning to 'i' in front of 'r'+consonant and, in the last stages of Illyrian (as evident from some names borrowed into Croatian from Illyrian), simplification of consonant clusters into geminate consonants ('rb'&gt;'rr' and 'nd'&gt;'nn'). The reconstructed grammar is then exemplified by translating the Lord's Prayer into Illyrian.

                Croatian is a Slavic language. However,
                I think there aren't actually that many Slavic toponyms in Croatia.
                If there were, they would make sense to those who speak Croatian, and
                the vast majority of them don't. Many of the toponyms commonly accepted
                to be Croatian in origin don't even sound (phonotactically) Croatian,
                such as <a class="map">Delnice</a> (the cluster <i>-eln-</i>, in native Croatian words,
                the 'l' in <i>-iln-</i> and <i>-eln-</i> gets vocalized into 'o',
                such as in "čeoni", derived from "čelo", or "dionica", derived from
                the verb "dijel-i-ti").<br/>
Furthermore, there are statistically significant patterns in the names of places in Croatia which Croatian language cannot explain. For instance, the first two consonants in river names tend to be <i>k</i> and <i>r</i>, respectively. And the probability of such a pattern occurring by chance is, if <a href="#english_summary">my measurements and calculations</a> are correct, somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17. I don't think it is speculation to say both that that pattern is statistically significant and that proponents of mainstream interpretation of the Croatian toponyms need to claim it is coincidental (See what Dubravka Ivšić, probably the greatest expert in Croatian toponyms today, <a href="#hear_both_sides">said in response to my paper</a> about that k-r pattern in the Croatian river names.).<br/>
So, I argue that attempts to explain
                the Croatian toponyms without an obvious etymology with Slavic roots
                is, in fact, a very flawed method (you can read more about why I think so <a href="#methodology">here</a>), and I attempt to reconstruct a
                language of the ancient Croatian toponyms (the Illyrian language) and
                explain the toponyms using it.<br/>
                <a name="introduction"></a>To give you an example, <i>Issa</i>, the
                ancient name for the island of <a class="map">Vis</a>, isn't explicable by Latin or
                Greek, and is widely stated to have an unknown, perhaps
                Pre-Indo-European etymology. But here is a clue: there were some
                quite strong springs there in ancient times, that the Roman baths were
                getting water from. Those springs were on the western side of the thermae,
                and they dried out completely in the middle of the 20th century (you can read
                more about ancient thermae on Vis in the
                <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33286142.pdf">Branimir Gabričević'es dissertation</a>
                on page 28). And wherever there were large Roman baths in
                Croatia, the same or similar element repeats. The ancient name for
                <a class="map">Daruvar</a> was <i>Balissa</i> and the ancient name for
                <a class="map">Varaždinske Toplice</a> was <i>Iasa</i>. There
                we have it: *issa~iasa meant &quot;spas&quot; (health-giving springs). And I believe I can
                trace that name back to Proto-Indo-European: it probably comes from
                *yos (spring, derived from *yes, "to boil") and the collective noun
                ending *eh<sub>2</sub> (probably pronounced &quot;ah&quot;). The <i>Bal-</i> in <i>Balissa</i>
                can be explained as being related to the Latin word <i>bullire</i> (to boil), so that
                <i>Balissa</i> means "boiling health-giving springs". Using that knowledge,
                we can explain some modern Croatian toponyms without an obvious Croatian
                etymology, like Jozinci (assuming an ancient name such as *Iasona,
                meaning "on the health-giving spring", in the sense "on the source of salt water",
                since salt was believed to have health-giving properties by people of ancient Slavonia).
                Namely, Jozinci is a small village near <a class="map">Donji Miholjac</a>. It's known that, in ancient times,
                there was a stream of brackish water flowing through Donji Miholjac, but it's
                not certain where its source was. It might have very well been in Jozinci
                (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('jozinci')">show/hide details</a>).<br/>
                <span id="jozinci" style="display:none">
                Of course, things are a lot more complicated than the above paragraph might lead you to believe.
                Here is what Dubravka Ivšić, perhaps the most prominent Croatian etymologist
                (supporting the mainstream interpretations of the Croatian toponyms),
                said about it when I asked her via e-mail:

                    Naselje "Issa" osnovali su Grci, a ne Iliri. Rimske terme su bile jednostavno

                    ponovno nije morfološki usporedivo. Ako i pretpostavimo da "Issa" i "Iasa"
                    pripadaju istom jeziku (što je malo vjerojatno), trebalo bi objasniti
                    razliku u obliku (ako ciljate na indoeuropski ablaut, treba objasniti kakav je
                    to ablaut i zašto se razlikuju stupnjevi).

                If you are not able to understand it, not even using <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a>, which
                usually does a good job translating Croatian to English (though not the other way around),
                perhaps you shouldn't proceed reading.<br/>
                Anyway, I find the arguments rather weak, primarily because the mainstream linguistics considers the name
                "Issa" to be related to the toponym <a class="map" data-look="Antissa,+Greece">Antissa</a> on the Greek island of Lesbos, and Vis and Lesbos are
                even further away from each other than Vis and Daruvar are. As for the Celtic suffix "-issa", it probably
                doesn't go back to Proto-Indo-European for it to be relevant here, since Proto-Indo-European phonotactics generally avoided geminates
                (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('geminati')">show/hide details</a>).
                There does indeed appear to be a suffix "-issia" in Illyrian. As for the differences in the grades of ablaut,
                that's not so surprising if you take into account that there were two words for spring in Proto-Slavic that were different only
		by a grade of ablaut, *virŭ and *vorŭ. Again, I can't promise you (and probably nobody can) to know all the relevant technical details.<br/>
		<i id="lacking_rudimentary_knowledge">(UPDATE on 08/10/2023: And this thing with suggesting that the Illyrian toponym "Balissa" should be compared with Celtic toponyms with the suffix "-issa", in my opinion, demonstrates why academia doesn't work. It produces experts with incredibly specialized knowledge, but even the rudimentary knowledge of closely related fields is lacking, or at least not taken into account. Dubravka Ivšić, as an expert on toponyms, has certainly read a lot English-language literature on toponyms, much of which is about Celtic toponyms, but the knowledge of basics of the Proto-Indo-European phonotactics (that Proto-Indo-European didn't have geminate consonants, and had some complicated strategies for avoiding them) appears to be lacking. One can only imagine how lacking the knowledge of informatics (which is perceived to be very distantly related to the study of toponyms) in academics who study toponyms is, and, in my opinion, basic knowledge of informatics is a key to understanding toponyms (to understand why that k-r pattern in the Croatian river names cannot happen by chance). Academics who know something about toponyms tend to know zilch about informatics, and academics who know something about informatics tend to know zilch about toponyms. Academia doesn't produce people who know basics of both, who can actually discover something new in the field of Croatian toponyms.)<br/></i>

                    Here is how Dubravka Ivšić responded to the question "Why would you assume that the suffix -issa, found in Celtic languages, also existed in Illyrian, when it obviously couldn't have existed in Proto-Indo-European (whose phonotactics didn't allow geminate consonants)?":
                    <span class="quotation" lang="hr">
                        Ako je sufiks -issa postojao u ilirskom, onda je to bio ilirski sufiks, kao što je svaki sufiks kojim se tvore hrvatske riječi hrvatski sufiks.<br/>
                        Međutim, postavlja se pitanje što je to ilirski. Po onome što se danas zna, čini se da se naziv "ilirski" koristi za domorodačke indoeuropske jezike na našem tlu (i šire) koji su se govorili prije latinskog i grčkog (neko vrijeme su supostojali), i čije su jedine potvrde toponimi i antroponimi zapisani latinskim i grčkim slovima. Vjerojatno je bilo više "ilirskih" jezika (npr. liburnski, delmatski, histarski) i nije jasno koliko su bili srodni. U novije doba govori se i o jednom takvom "panonskom" jeziku, kojem bi pripadali i (neki) predslavenski toponimi u sjevernoj Hrvatskoj. U sjevernoj Hrvatskoj još postoji i teoretska mogućnost keltskih toponima (iako je samo Carrodunum sigurno keltski), pa ako je Certissa keltskog podrijetla, onda je u njemu sufiks -issa keltski. Uglavnom, to je metodološko pitanje - kako ćemo što definirati, a o svemu skupa ima premalo podataka da bismo išta sigurno tvrdili.<br/>
                        To što u praindoeuropskom nisu postojale geminate ne znači da se one nisu mogle razviti u pojedinim jezicima.

                    I'll leave you there to decide for youself. I took that as an admission that the mainstream interpretation of the names of places in Croatia goes against not only combinatorial evidence, but also against accepted facts (though not strictly, it's possible, although it's unlikely, that the identical suffix developed in both Illyrian and Celtic) from comparative linguistics. While linguistics is not a science in the same way physics is, that doesn't mean such things don't matter.<br/>

                By far the most common counter-argument I get is that, if a toponym doesn't come from Croatian, perhaps it comes from some other attested language, the most commonly proposed being Latin. Most of the such proposed etymologies can be easily refuted, <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('latin')">click here</a> to see (or hide) how.<br/>

                    <img src="rules.png" style="width:100%;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px" alt="The sound-change laws for the Latin toponyms in Croatia."/>
                    Many, if not most of the, supposed Latin etymologies of the toponyms of modern-day Croatia can be refuted simply by pointing to the basic facts of the historical phonology. They should be the way of establishing the basic rigour in studying the toponyms. Nevertheless, they are only rarely mentioned in the papers about toponyms. Here are the ones that I consider to be most important. Classical Latin long /i/, in Vulgar Latin, turned into a sound similar or identical to the Old Croatian front yer, that later, according to the Havlik's Law (and, in the Chakavian dialect of Croatian, the law that the yers in the first syllable are always vocalized), turned into 'a' (or 'e' in the Kaikavian dialect) or simply disappeared. A beautiful example of that is the toponym <a class="map">Cavtat</a> (folk etymologies often connect it to the Croatian word <i>cvat</i>, meaning <i>flower</i>), derived from Latin <i>Cīvitāte (Vetere)</i> (in the old city). Similarly, the ancient name for <a class="map">Caska</a> was <i>Cīssa</i> (probably an Illyrian word related to the Greek name for the ivy plant, κισσος). Classical Latin short /i/, in Vulgar Latin, turned into a sound similar or identical to Old Croatian yat, which, in standard Croatian, turned into the diphthong /ie/ (spelled 'je' or 'ije'). A beautiful example of that is the toponym <a class="map">Srijem</a>, from the Latin name <i>Sĭrmĭum</i> (the name is obviously Illyrian in origin, from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/ser-1.htm">root</a> meaning "flow", as there are many rivers there, the /r/ and the yat switched places regularly due to the metathesis of the liquids, operating in Croatian until the 11th century). It's interesting to note that, in antiquity, there were three places named <i>Sirmium</i>, one was the modern-day Srijem, the other one was the modern-day Šibenik (whose ancient name is preserved in the name of the peninsula <a class="map">Srima</a>), and the third one is <a class="map" data-look="Sirmione">Sirmione</a>. The apparent counter-examples (<a class="map">Silba</a>&lt;sĭlva, <a class="map">Piškera</a>&lt;pĭscis...) are confined to the dialects in which the Old Croatian yat regularly turned to /i/. The same is true for the Classical Latin short 'e', which is illustrated by the Latin name for <a class="map">Mljet</a>, <i>Melita</i> (which is probably a Pre-Indo-European word for sea island, compare the toponyms <a class="map">Molat</a> and <a class="map" data-look="Malta">Malta</a>). Classical Latin long /u/ turned into a sound similar or identical to the Old Croatian back yer, which behaved just like the front yer, except that it didn't participate in the Second Slavic Palatalization (still productive in modern Croatian). For example, the Latin name for the island of <a class="map">Krk</a> was <i>Cūricum</i> (perhaps from an Illyrian word meaning "north", <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/k̂ēu̯ero-_k̂ōu̯ero-_auch_sk̂ūro.htm">related</a> to Lithuanian "šiaure" and Latin "caurus"). Vulgar Latin short 'u' turned into 'o'. For instance, the Latin name for <a class="map">Rovinj</a> was <i>Ruinium</i>. The only counter-example I know is the name <a class="map">Trogir</a>, derived from the Latin name <i>Tragurium</i>, but that's actually a name (apparently) derived from a Greek word (τραγος, goat), and the 'u' may have been pronounced /y/. Vulgar Latin long /o/ usually gets borrowed as /u/ in Old Croatian, because, quite simply, Old Croatian didn't have long /o/. An example of that is the toponym <a class="map">Pula</a> (from the Latin name <i>Pōla</i>, probably from an Illyrian word <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/pel-1_pelə-_plē.htm">related</a> to the Greek word πολις). Apparent counter-examples (<a class="map">Labin</a>&lt;Albona, <a class="map">Solin</a>&lt;Salona...) are explicable as Croats changing the suffix to fit their declension patterns. And, of course, the most obvious rule, yet apparently sometimes ignored, the Classical Latin long and short 'a' came to be pronounced as a sound that was almost always borrowed as 'o' in Old Croatian (<a class="map">Trogir</a>&lt;Tragurion, <a class="map">Solin</a>&lt;Salona, <a class="map">Mosor</a>&lt;Massarum...). Almost all the apparent counter-examples (<a class="map">Labin</a>&lt;Albona, <a class="map">Raša</a>&lt;Arsia, <a class="map">Skradin</a>&lt;Scardona...) are explicable as a result of the metathesis of liquids, which regularly turned *orC and *olC into /raC/ and /laC/. Other apparent counter-examples can be explained as borrowing directly from Illyrian (<a class="map">Drava</a>, <a class="map">Sava</a>...) or, coincidentally, unknown phonotactical details of Old Croatian (the Latin names for Drava and Sava were <i>Draus</i> and <i>Saus</i>, but Proto-Slavic didn't allow wovel sequences within a morpheme). Of course, sometimes (usually quite obvious) folk-etymologies change the accents (and therefore, by affecting the later sound-changes, the vowels), such as in the case of the island name <a class="map">Lastovo</a> (the ancient name was <i>Ladesta</i>, perhaps an Illyrian word derived from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/lat.htm">root</a> meaning "water", but the modern name looks as if it was from the Croatian word for the swallow bird, "lasta"), however those things happen rather rarely. Another rule, maybe slightly less obvious, but still hard to miss if you study Croatian toponyms, the Classical Latin /v/ turned into /β/ in Vulgar Latin, which was regularly borrowed as /b/ in Old Croatian (<a class="map">Silba</a>&lt;silva, <a class="map">Bribir</a>&lt;Varvaria...). Therefore, the toponyms starting with a 'v' can't be Latin in origin. Those rules are especially accurate if you look at the names in the local dialects. For instance, the name for <a class="map">Brač</a> (ancient name <i>Brattia</i>) in the local dialect is <i>Broc</i>, the name for <a class="map">Hvar</a> (ancient name <i>Pharos</i>) in the local dialect is <i>For</i>, and the name for <a class="map">Šolta</a> (ancient name <i>Solenta</i>) in the local dialect is <i>Sulet</i> (probably because the exonyms weren't actually borrowed from Vulgar Latin).<br/>Yet, those things are often ignored by the etymologists. For instance, the mainstream etymology considers the toponym <a class="map">Viljevo</a> to be derived from the Latin word <i>vīlla</i>. The simple truth is, <i>vīlla</i>, borrowed into Old Croatian, would give something like <i>*Bal</i> (genitive singular <i>*Bla</i>) in Modern Croatian (in my opinion, the name <i>Viljevo</i> is indeed related to the homonymous dialectal Croatian word meaning <i>oak forest</i>, which is perhaps derived from a phrase meaning "in the Saint Elias'es forest"). The mainstream etymology considers the toponym <a class="map">Batina</a> to be derived from Latin <i>*Batinus</i> (dedicated to Bato the Illyrian). Well, first of all, the grammatical way for naming a city after a person named <i>Bato</i> would be <i>*Batinianus</i>. Second, <i>*Batinus</i>, borrowed into Old Croatian, would give <i>*Boten</i> or <i>*Botan</i> in modern Croatian. So much about it. Besides, there is an identical name of place near <a class="map">Kutina</a>, hundreds of miles away. Some people (though it's not really mainstream linguistics) say that the name of the river <a class="map">Una</a> derives from the Latin word <i>ūna</i> (one) supposedly in the sense "the most beautiful". Well, first, if you were to name a river as "the most beautiful", you would use the Latin word <i>primum (flumen)</i>, and certainly not <i>una</i>. Second, <i>ūna</i>, borrowed into Old Croatian, would give <i>*Van</i> in modern Croatian (the prothetic 'v' would have to be added in front of the back yer). I hope you see where I am coming from. The phonology of Vulgar Latin is known, and it doesn't explain most of the modern Croatian toponyms. The phonology of Illyrian is not known right now, but it can hopefully be reconstructed from the toponyms.<br/>
<i>(UPDATE on 23/03/2025: I've opened <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/1jhgwcv/why_is_dolphin_called_dupin_dlpin_in_croatian/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">a Reddit thread about the etymology of the Croatian word &quot;dupin&quot; (dolphin)</a>. If it comes from Latin &quot;delphīnus&quot;, why isn't it called something like *dlijepan? Why was the short 'e' borrowed as front yer, rather than as yat (as in Mljet &lt; *Melta &lt; Melita)? Why was the long 'i' not borrowed as front yer (as in Cavtat &lt; Civitate), but as yeri (?)?)</i><br/>
I'd suggest you to read the end of <a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/46824/20821">this StackExchange answer by Janus Bahs Jacquet</a>, where he speculates how it is that Latin 'o' in the toponyms doesn't get borrowed as 'o' in Croatian.<br/>
                    And the same goes for some other languages that are suggested to be the source of modern-day Croatian toponyms. Mainstream linguistics connects the ancient name for <a class="map">Split</a>, <i>Spalatum</i>, with the Greek word for <i>spiny broom</i> (a flower), <i>ασπαλαθος</i>. Yet, the modern name <i>Split</i> points to it being borrowed as <i>*Speltos</i>, with an alternation between 'a' in <i>Spalatum</i> and 'e' in <i>*Speltos</i>. This alternation would have been irregular in Ancient Greek, but it might have very well been regular in Illyrian (since, for instance, the name <a class="map">Dalmatia</a> was also attested in antiquity as "Delmatia", and the ancient name for the island of Brač, "Brattia", was also attested as "Brettia", and those names are without a doubt Illyrian). In addition to that, a placename being apparently derived from a plant name or an animal name without there being a suffix (as in the case of <i>Spalatum</i> being apparently derived from <i>aspalathos</i>) is a typical sign of a folk-etymology.<br/>
					The strong bias to assign the origins of names of places in Croatia to Latin and Greek is also seen in what's written about the name <a class="map">Koška</a>, namely, that it comes from Latin <i>castellum</i> (castle). The phonetic difficulties with connecting the two are rather obvious, and, not only that, there is an identical toponym on the island of <a class="map" data-look="Koška,+Šolta">Šolta</a>, and, in the local dialect, <i>koška</i> means <i>rock whose shape reminds of a bird</i>, from Proto-Slavic *kosŭ (<i>blackbird</i>, probably itself from Greek <i>κοψιχος</i>) and the adjective ending <i>-ka</i>. Doesn't it make by orders of magnitude more sense to suggest those two toponyms are related, and that <i>koška</i> used to mean the same thing in the Slavonian dialect of Croatian?<br/>
                </span>
                Here is a list of
                the etymologies of the Croatian toponyms I've supported on the
                &quot;Croatian Toponyms&quot; thread linked on the left:<br/>
                Aenona
                (<a class="map">Nin</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>ek<sup>j</sup>-mon (where a lot of stones
                are)<br/>
                Albona (<a class="map">Labin</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>elb<sup>h</sup>
                (white). It's unknown what the precise pronunciation of 'b' was, some sources spell it as 'v'. It might have been /β/.<br/>
                Alma (<a class="map">Fruška Gora</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>elm
                (fertile)<br/>
                Almissia (<a class="map">Omiš</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>elm-yess (on a
                fertile ground)<br/>
                Andautonia (<a class="map">Zagreb</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>en-d<sup>h</sup>eh<sub>2</sub>-ont-om
                (near that which flows). The name <i>Zagreb</i> itself probably means "the God's hill", from the Illyrian word <i>Dzis</i> (God), mentioned on the Messapian inscriptions, and a word related to Proto-Slavic *gora and Sanskrit <i>giri</i>. So, the Illyrian name might have been *Dzigurevos, borrowed into Old Croatian via Vulgar Latin.<br/>
                <a class="map">Apševci</a> &lt; from an Illyrian name (borrowed directly from Illyrian, not via Vulgar Latin) such as *Apissios, meaning "river island", derived from the Indo-European root *h<sub>2</sub>ep (water), for the semantics compare the Croatian toponym <a class="map">Otok</a> near <a class="map">Vinkovci</a>. Similar names occur repeatedly in microtoponymy, for instance, near <a class="map">Donji Miholjac</a> there is a field called Apšaldol.<br/>
                Arsia (<a class="map">Raša river</a>) &lt; *h<sub>3</sub>rews
                (to flow fast)<br/>
                Asinium (<a class="map">Sinj</a>) &lt; related to Proto-Slavic *asenŭ (ash tree). Or, perhaps even more likely, related to the Hittite word <i>haš</i> (stone), since the same element repeats in the names of other stony places. For instance, the ancient name for <a class="map">Osor</a> was <i>Assarum</i>. I have asked a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-the-names-of-Croatian-cities-Sinj-ancient-name-Assinium-and-Senj-ancient-name-Senia-Do-you-agree-with-mainstream-history-that-Assinium-meant-ash-tree-and-Senia-old-city-in-Illyrian-Do-you">question on Quora</a> what people think about my idea that the names Sinj and <a class="map">Senj</a> are related.<br/>
                Balissa (<a class="map">Daruvar</a>) &lt; *boll-yos-eh<sub>2</sub>
                (where a lot of health-giving boiling springs are)<br/>
		The only interesting objection I got to that etymology (as well as to my etymoligies of Issa and Iasa) is &quot;<i>Given that there are many Celtic toponyms in which -issa is a suffix, don't you think it is way more probable that -issa in Balissa is a suffix, rather than that it is a compound word?</i>&quot;. And if we knew nothing about the Proto-Indo-European phonotactics, perhaps that would be a good objection. But we have very good reasons to think Proto-Indo-European phonotactics didn't allow geminate consonants, so that the suffix -issa couldn't have existed in Proto-Indo-European. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to suppose that the Celtic suffix -issa existed in Illyrian.<br/>
                <a class="map">Baranja</a> &lt;
                some sort of derivation from *mory (marsh), compare also Greek
                βορβορος and the ancient (almost certainly Illyrian) name for the river <a class="map" data-look="Bojana+river,+Montenegro" name="Bojana">Bojana</a>, "Barbanna" (attested by Titus Livius in Historia Romana in the 44th book and the 31st chapter). The Illyrian name might have been *Barrania, with the first 'a' stressed and long, compare the ancient name for <a class="map">Dinara</a>, "Dindaria" (while the modern name looks like as if it was from *Dinnaria), for the consonant cluster, in this case -rb- to -rr-, simplification.<br/>
                <a class="map" data-look="Bosut,+Hrvatska">Biđ</a> (the river) &lt; From an Illyrian name such as *Vōdios, from Proto-Indo-European *wed (wet), borrowed into Old Croatian from Vulgar Latin (therefore, 'v' regularly being borrowed as *b, long 'o' as *y, turning into 'i' in Modern Croatian, and 'di' regularly yotated into 'đ'). Alternatively, I don't know much about Germanic languages, but I speculate it may be possible that the name "<i>Biđ</i>" is of Germanic origin, related to English word "beach", which used to mean "stream" in Old English ("<i>bæce</i>").<br/>
                Basante, Basuntius (<a class="map">Bosut</a>) &lt; *bel-sewh<sub>1</sub>-nt (strong
                waterer), see "Sutla" and "Sunja" for the sound changes. Modern name obviously comes from the name Basante (attested on Tabula Peutingeriana), rather than Basuntius (attested by Pliny the Elder in the 3rd book in the 28th chapter of Naturalis Historia), it's hard to tell what was the relationship between those two names in antiquity. I'd argue that Basuntius is more original, and that Basante is some form of folk etymology.<br/>
		<a class="map" data-look="Belgrade,+Serbia">Belgrade</a> (the capital city of Serbia) &lt; Mainstream linguistics derives the name <i>Belgrade</i> from Serbo-Croatian for <i>white city</i>. However, I think it is possible, if not probable, that it is a folk etymology, and that the correct reading is <i>city on a hill</i>. Consider the name of the city <a class="map">Beli Manastir</a> in eastern Croatia. It seems to come from Croatian for <i>white monastery</i>, but that is a folk etymology. In many historical sources, it was written as <i><b>Pel</b>monostor</i>. It is unclear what the word <i>pel</i> meant. Some speculate it could be a word for <i>hill</i>, but, even so, it is of unclear etymology (the nearly-homophonous Indo-European root <i>*pelth<sub>1</sub></i> means <i>field</i>, which is exactly the opposite). So, I believe it is possible, if not probable, that the <i>Bel</i> in the name <i>Belgrade</i> shares the same root, rather coming from the Slavic root meaning <i>white</i>.<br/>
                Brettia (<a class="map">Brač</a>) &lt; To give some context, Stephanus of Byzantium wrote, in <i>De Urbibus</i>, that "Brettia", the ancient name for the island of Brač, means <i>deer's</i> (<i>Ελαφουσσα</i>) in Illyrian. That makes some sense considering that Strabo also wrote, in the 7th book in the 6th chapter of Geography, that "Brentesium", the ancient name for <a class="map" data-look="Brindisi,+Italy">Brindisi</a>, meant <i>deer's</i> in Messapian (probably a dialect of Illyrian), because its port resembles head of a deer. Also, <i>briedis</i> is the modern Latvian word for deer, so there is a plausible etymology of that Illyrian word. However, Stephanus of Byzantium also wrote that there is a stream (<i>ποταμος</i>) on the island of Brač that's also named "Brettia". It's hard to tell how plausible that is (I am not too familiar with geology), as there are no streams today on the island of Brač. Assuming that's true, that would probably mean that "Brettia" meaning "deer's" is folk etymology, since places are usually named after bodies of water rather than the other way around, and that the name "Brettia" is, in fact, related to names such as <a href="#Bojana"><i>Barbanna</i></a>. Another argument for that is that there is a stream in northern Croatia called <a class="map">Jelenska</a>, it flows into the <a class="map">Lonja River</a>, and the name <i>Jelenska</i> appears to come from the Croatian word for deer, <i>jelen</i>. It makes sense to suppose that's a similar folk-etymology, that Croatians translated an Illyrian name such as <i>Brettia</i> thinking it comes from the Illyrian word for deer, when it fact it's related to the Greek word <i>βορβορος</i>.<br/>
				Celenae (<a class="map">Orolik</a>) &lt; This name is attested only in the Burdigal (Jerusalem) Itinerary, as a horse market on a steep hill near Cibalae (<a class="map">Vinkovci</a>). Mainstream history places it in Orolik, and that seems like a reasonable assumption. Regarding etymology, my guess is that it is a celestially-themed name, related to Latin <i>caelum</i>, that it means something like <i>road to sky</i>.

		Curicum (<a class="map">Krk</a>) &lt; The mainstream linguistics considers this name to predate the Illyrian language. However, I think there are at least three not-so-implausible scenarios in which the name would indeed be Illyrian in origin. It could come from the root <i>*karr~kurr</i> meaning <i>to flow</i>, to be named after some stream on the island. Or maybe it literally meant <i>island</i>, the same semantic construction as Croatian <i>otok</i>, from <i>o</i> meaning <i>around</i> and <i>tok</i> meaning <i>flow</i>, and presumably the island name <i>Solenta</i> (ancient name for <a class="map">Šolta</a>, from the same root as the river name <i>Salia</i>, the ancient name for <a class="map">Jadro</a>, and let's assume <i>-enta</i> meant <i>around</i>). Or it could come from the same root as the Latin word <i>caurus</i> meaning <i>northern wind</i>, as Krk is the northernmost major island in the Adriatic sea.<br/>

The toponym *Daurum wasn't attested in antiquity per se, but the ancient name for <a class="map">Cavtat</a> (some 10 kilometers from Dubrovnik) was <i>Epi-Daurum</i> ("epi" almost certainly being the Greek prefix meaning "beside"). *Daur- borrowed into Old Croatian would regularly give *Dubr in modern Croatian, for the sound changes compare the ancient name for <a class="map">Bribir</a>, <i>Varuaria</i> (by the way, I think the modern name <a class="map">Varivode</a> could also derive from the ancient name of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Bribir,+%C5%A0ibensko-kninska+%C5%BEupanija/Varivode,+%C5%A0ibensko-kninska+%C5%BEupanija/@43.9432458,15.8373636,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x47602afe63a2cda7:0xaf8534a9d2122784!2m2!1d15.8437672!2d43.9220009!1m5!1m1!1s0x47602b8bcb2f94ab:0xe244f31f0765e846!2m2!1d15.8794758!2d43.9548803">near-by</a> place <i>Varuaria</i>, attested by Pliny the Elder in Naturalis Historia in book 3 chapter 25, as a later borrowing from Illyrian into Croatian). A commonly cited etymology is that "Dubrovnik" comes from the Croatian word "dubrava" (oak forest). Well, first of all, it's not clear why the 'a' would turn to 'o'. It's also not clear why the ktetic would be irregular, people from Dubrovnik are called "Dubrovčani", rather than the expected "Dubrovničani".<br/>

See also <a href="Karasica.doc">the paper I have written about the name Karašica</a>. The ancient name could have been something like <i>*Kurrurrissia</i> or <i>*Kurrirrissia</i>, borrowed directly from Illyrian (so, not via Latin). The second syllable *urr/*irr could either be related to Ira (the ancient name for Mura) or to Varvaria (the ancient name for Bribir near &Scaron;ibenik, from the Indo-European root *weh<sub>1</sub>r meaning <i>water</i>).<br/>
See this diagram from my paper:<br/>

I received criticism on some Internet forum that Proto-Slavic phonotactics didn't allow four consecutive syllables with yers (as in my supposed Proto-Slavic form *Kъrъrьsьja). I don't know whether that's true, so I asked <a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/48175/20821">a StackExchange question about that</a>. Besides, if that is true, how it is that mainstream linguistics derives the name <a class="map">Cavtat</a> from Latin "<i>(in) civitate</i>"? The supposed Proto-Slavic form, borrowed from Latin, is, if I understand it correctly, <i>*Kьvьtъtь</i>. If we suppose Proto-Slavic had a strict phonotactic rule preventing four syllables with yers from being consecutive, don't we have to reject <b>that</b> etymology as well?
<br/>
<a class="map">Karin</a> &lt; Now, mainstream linguistics considers the name &quot;Karin&quot; to derive from the ancient Celtic name &quot;Corinium&quot;. I think that's very unlikely, for two reasons. First of all, how did the 'o' change to 'a'? Even if we assume the Celtic 'o' was borrowed as a back yer, we would expect it to disappear due to the Havlik's Law (as the vowel in the following syllable is a full vowel), rather than to change to 'a'. Second, why wasn't the 'n' yotated? In other words, I would expect Celtic &quot;Corinium&quot; to give something like *Krinj in Modern Croatian, rahter than "Karin". So, I suppose the name "Karin" is actually Slavic in origin, meaning "belonging to a person named *Kara". I've opened a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/croatian/comments/1gl4klb/kako_ime_grada_karin_dolazi_od_keltskog_imena/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Reddit thread</a> about that.<br/>

                <a class="map">Knin</a> &lt; This time, a bit different from other etymologies suggested here, mainstream linguistics considers the name <i>Knin</i> to be Illyrian in origin, while I consider it to be Croatian in origin. I think deriving the modern name <i>Knin</i> from the ancient name <i>Tininium</i> to be phonetically implausible for at least two reasons. First, the most obvious problem is the apparently-inexplicable change from the initial '<i>t</i>' to the initial '<i>k</i>'. Second, why wouldn't the second '<i>n</i>' turn into '<i>nj</i>' via iotation? I would expect <i>Tininium</i> to change into either <i>Tnanj</i> or <i>Tnenj</i> (or maybe <i>Tninj</i>, if you assume some Croatian dialect where Proto-Slavic yat changes into '<i>i</i>' was once spoken in Knin), depending on the accent (whether the '<i>i</i>' in the second syllable was long or short), and certainly not <i>Knin</i>. So, I think a much more plausible explanation is that <i>Knin</i> means &quot;<i>a place on the road to Nin</i>&quot; (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('detailsKnin')">show/hide details</a>).<br/>
                <span id="detailsKnin" style="display: none;">I asked a <a href="https://www.quora.com/Are-the-names-of-the-Croatian-cities-Nin-and-Knin-related-Does-Knin-mean-something-like-on-a-road-towards-Nin-Or-does-the-name-Knin-really-come-from-ancient-name-Tininium-If-so-how-did-t-change-into-k-Why-didnt-n">question on Quora about the name <i>Knin</i></a>, and I got the following answer from David Mandić, which I assume represents the mainstream linguistics well:
                    <span class="quotation">
                        <b>Are the names of the Croatian cities Nin and Knin related? Does "Knin" mean something like " (on a road) towards Nin"? Or does the name Knin really come from ancient name "Tininium"? If so, how did 't' change into 'k'? Why didn't 'n' turn to 'nj'?</b>
<br/><br/>
                        The name <i>Nin</i> comes from <i>Aenona</i>, which might have been pronounced [eno:na] or so in Late Latin. <i>Knin</i> comes from <i>Tininium</i>, possibly pronounced [teni:njo] in Late Latin.
<br/><br/>
                        Latin unstressed short vowels (except '<i>a</i>') were interpreted by Common Slavic speakers as yers (essentially, short centralised '<i>i</i>' and '<i>u</i>', or something like that). Latin long '<i>o</i>' (whatever sound it had evolved into in Late Latin) was usually adopted into Slavic as /u:/ which was probably centralised and unrounded too (that is, to a sound represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet as [ɯ] or perhaps the one represented by [ɨ]). This later became /i/ in Croatian.
<br/><br/>
                        The initial vowel in <i>Aenona</i> fell out for some reason, so Common Slavic: *nɯ:nʊ or *nɨ:nʊ (traditional Slavicist transcription *nynъ), which became <i>Nȋn</i> in Croatian.
<br/><br/>
                        I’m not sure about the second '<i>n</i>' in &quot;<i>Knin</i>&quot;, why it wasn’t palatalised to what we spell as '<i>nj</i>' (International Phonetic Alphabet '<i>ɲ</i>'). Perhaps local Slavic speakers perceived the original Latin sound as more similar to their '<i>n</i>' than to '<i>ɲ</i>'. Or the sequence <i>n…ɲ</i> became assimilated to <i>n…n</i>. Or it was some sort of analogy. Or there was another Latin version: <i>Tininum</i>. I don’t know, really.
<br/><br/>
                        Latin <i>Tininium</i> would have been interpreted in Common Slavic as *tɪni:njɪ (trad. *tьnińь) but let’s say the ending was reinterpreted as early as that, so the word was *tɪni:nʊ (trad. *tьninъ). After the loss of yers, the word started in '<i>tn</i>'.
<br/><br/>
                        This type of consonant clusters tends to change somehow in various dialects, so for example, in the dialect spoken in Zagreb <i>kmica</i> &lt; <i>tmica</i> (<i>darkness</i>, a diminutive form of the archaic Croatian <i>tmina</i>, the word for &quot;<i>darkness</i>&quot; in modern standard Croatian is &quot;<i>tama</i>&quot;), or in Standard Croatian <i>kći</i> &lt; <i>tći</i> &lt; *dъći (from Proto-Slavic *dъšti). This is a type of dissimilation, because velar '<i>k</i>' is more distant from '<i>m</i>', '<i>n</i>', '<i>ć</i>', in the place of articulation than '<i>t</i>' is.
<br/><br/>
                        So *tnin became <I>Knȋn</I>.
<br/><br/>
                        The first '<i>n</i>' is also expected to be palatalised in <i>Knin</i>, i.e. it should be called *Knjinj actually, because '<i>n</i>' was palatalised between '<i>k</i>'/'<i>g</i>' and '<i>i</i>', cf. <i>knjiga</i> (<i>book</i>, from Old Chinese <i>卷</i>, pronounced <i>k'üen</i>, meaning <i>book</i> or <i>scroll</i>), <i>gnjilo</i> (<i>rotten</i>, of Germanic origin and related to English <i>knead</i>). But this palatalisation must have preceded the change of '<i>tn</i>' to '<i>kn</i>', so it never happened here.
<br/><br/>
                        Both place-names are pre-Roman and come from some unattested language which was spoken there before the Roman conquest (possibly by the Liburni or Delmatae, or even by someone who was there before them). So nobody really knows what they mean. However, <i>Aenona</i> is interesting because it ends in <i>-ona</i>, the same as <i>Narona</i> (Vid near Metković), <i>Salona</i> (Solin), <i>Scardona</i> (Skradin), <i>Flanona</i> (Plomin in Istria), <i>Albona</i> (Labin), etc., which might be the same thing as in <i>Cremona</i>, <i>Gemona</i>, etc. in north-east Italy.
<br/><br/>
                        As for the possibility that <i>Knin</i> may mean ‘<i>to Nin</i>’, because Croatian '<i>k</i>' “<i>to</i>”, well, compounds like that are uncommon (or non-existent). I’m not aware of any Croatian placename that’s composed solely of a preposition and another placename. At least, there would also be a suffix referring to a place/area, such as <i>-je</i> in <i>Podunavlje</i> (<i>near Danube</i>, because Danube is called <i>Dunav</i> in Croatian), <i>Pokuplje</i> (<i>near the Kupa river</i>), <i>Međimurje</i> (from <i>među</i> meaning <i>between</i> and the river name <i>Mura</i>, because it is between Drava and Mura rivers), or based on a common noun: <i>Primorje</i> (<i>near the sea</i>, from <i>pri</i> meaning <i>near</i> and <i>more</i> meaning <i>sea</i>), <i>Podbrežje</i> (<i>at the bottom of the hill</i>, from <i>pod</i> meaning <i>floor</i> or <i>under</i> and <i>brijeg</i> meaning <i>hill</i>), etc.

                &lt; *lewk (clear)<br/>
                Lissa &lt; This toponym was attested in ancient times by Pliny the Elder in Naturalis Historia in 3rd book in the 63rd chapter as "Contra Iader est Lissa.", <i>Iader</i> being the ancient name for <a class="map">Zadar</a>. The mainstream history generally considers that toponym to be a corruption of the ancient name for <a class="map">Pag</a>, <i>Cissa</i>. However, I think that, if Pliny wanted to refer to Pag, he could a lot more appropriately write "contra Aenonam" or, even better, "contra Vegium" (<i>Vegium</i> being the ancient name for <a class="map">Karlobag</a>), rather than "contra Iader". So, I think this toponym, in antiquity, referred to <a class="map">Ugljan</a>. And I think that, in the late stages of Illyrian, that was the generic word for island, whichever root it comes from. Namely, the modern Italian name for <a class="map">Vis</a> is <i>Lissa</i>, and the modern Italian name for <a class="map">Hvar</a> is <i>Lesina</i>. The modern island name <a class="map">Lošinj</a>, unattested in antiquity, could come from that same root (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('aboutLissa')">show/hide details</a>).<br/>

                <span class="quotation"><b>Do you think the names Lissa (ancient name for Ugljan island, as Pliny wrote "Contra Iader est Lissa"), Lissa (modern Italian name for Vis island), Lesina (modern Italian name for Hvar island) and Lošinj islands are related? Why or why not?</b>
<br/><br/>
                  I’m pretty sure modern Italian Lissa (Vis) comes from Ancient Greek Issa, where the initial L might be the original Italian definite article which merged with the noun (*L’Issa).
<br/><br/>
                  The name Lošinj (Ital. Lussino) used to refer only to the two towns on the island, I think. The island used to be attached to the Island of Cres in ancient times and both land masses were called Apsyrtides or Apsoros (hence the name of the town of Osor).
<br/><br/>
                  The etymologies of Lošinj, Lesina (Hvar) and Lissa (Ugljan?) aren’t clear.
<br/><br/>
                  It’s also unknown whether Lissa referred to the whole island of Ugljan, or to some place on that island, or perhaps to the island of Iž.

                <a class="map">Medvednica</a> (the mountain) &lt; from an Illyrian name such as *Menduenda, from the Indo-European root *men (to be high), perhaps exactly cognate to the Latin word <i>mons</i> (genitive singular <i>montis</i>), compare Dindaria for the change from <i>-nt-</i> to <i>-nd-</i>. It shares the same root as the ancient name for <a class="map">Knin</a>, <i>Pria<b>mon</b>a</i> (attested by Strabo in the 7th book in the 5th chapter of Geography, <i>Pria-mona</i> can be read as <i>in front of a mountain</i>, because it is in front of a mountain when lookng from the seaside) and <i><b>Man</b>touna</i>, the ancient name for <a class="map">Motovun</a>.<br/>
		<a class="map">Mljet</a> &lt; I consider it obvious that there was a word <i>*melit~malit</i> meaning <i>sea island</i>, from which the names <a class="map" data-look="Malta">Malta</a>, <a class="map">Mljet</a>, <a class="map">Molat</a> and <a class="map">Melta (now-bridged island near Zadar)</a> come from.

                &lt; *ner (to dive) It's interesting to note that the names of many rivers that aren't even partly underground come from a word meaning "to dive". For instance, the name of the river <a class="map" data-look="Jordan+river,+Israel">Jordan</a> most likely comes from a Phoenician word sharing the same root as Hebrew word <i>יָרַד</i> (<i>yarad</i>), meaning <i>to dive</i>.<br/>

The ancient name for <a class="map">Rijeka Dubrovačka</a>, <i>Arion</i>, attested by Pseudoskylax, probably comes from the same root, and so does the ancient name for <a class="map">Dragonja</a>, <i>Argaone</i> (attested in Ravenna Cosmography).<br/>

However, it's possible it's actually Pelasgian, rather than Indo-European in origin, because similar names with apparently the same meaning appear in Greece. For example, the hill named <i>Σκαρδαμυλα</i> near Sparta and a cliff on the Island of Χιος named <a class="map" data-look="Kardamyla,+Chios,+Greece">Καρδαμυλα</a> (on which a large letter <i>V</i> signifying victory of Allied in World War 2 is painted).<br/>

                Siscia (<a class="map">Sisak</a>) &lt; *sek (to cut), in the sense "where Romans have cut the forest". As for the change from <i>Siscia</i> to <i>Sisak</i>, I think the simplest explanation is, as silly as this sounds, a folk-etymology connecting the name to <i>sisa</i>, a (rather vulgar) Croatian word for breast. Hills names after a word for breast are not very rare, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbles#Toponym">Mumbles</a>. I have opened a <a href="https://qr.ae/pGJ4A9">Quora question</a> about that.<br/>

                lake), so that it's an eponym of the near-by town <a class="map">Slatina</a> (Croatian for "salt lake"), compare "Almissia">"Omiš" for the sound changes.<br/>
                <a class="map">Sunja</a> (the river)
                &lt; *suh<sub>1</sub>-nt (that which waters the ground), the Illyrian name might have been *Sunneos (with a consonant cluster simplification seen in "Dinara"), the Illyrian nasalized 'u' might have been borrowed as nasalized 'o' in Old Croatian.<br/>
                <a class="map">Sutla</a> (the river) &lt;
                *suh<sub>1</sub>-nt (that which waters the ground), the Illyrian nasalized 'u' might have been borrowed as nasalized 'o' in Old Croatian.<br/>
                Tarda (<a class="map">Darda</a>)
                &lt; *ters (dry land)<br/>
                Ulciria (<a class="map">Ujilica</a>) &lt; The same root as <a href="#Vuka">Vuka</a>, in the sense "mountain that isn't stony". The modern name is a translation of that name, from Proto-Slavic *ilъ (mud), from the same root as Greek <i>ιλυς</i>. The 'u' in the beginning is from the Croatian word for 'in' or 'into' (similar to how the name <i>Issa</i> became <i>Vis</i> in modern Croatian), 'u', and the suffix '-ica' is the Croatian diminutive suffix.<br/>
		<a class="map">Umag</a> - I consider it at least possible, if not probable, that the names "Umag" and "<a class="map">Magadenovac</a>" are related. The 'u-' in "Umag" can easily be the Croatian prefix 'u-' meaning "in" or "into", which was frequently added to the names of places (Vis, Ujilica...).<br/>
                <a class="map">Una</a> (the river) &lt; *unt (wave, the Illyrian nasalized 'u' could be borrowed as nasalized 'o' into Old Croatian, compare "Andautonia" for the change from Indo-European *nt to 'n' in Illyrian). There are some other cases around the world of a river being named after a word meaning "wave", for instance, the river <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnia_River">Vilnia</a> in Lithuania. The name might be even influenced by phonosemantics, because "Una" is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Una_River">name</a> to numerous rivers around the world, and also the <a href="http://www.etruskisch.de/pgs/vc.htm">Etruscan</a> word for stream.<br/>
                Valeriana (<a class="map">Baranja</a>) &lt; *wel-h<sub>1</sub>er (wet
                valley)<br/>
		<a class="map">Vir</a> - Mainstream linguistics thinks that the name <i>Vir</i> comes from unattested Illyrian name <i>Ura</i> (whatever that name meant). I consider it to be at least as likely that it comes from the Proto-Slavic word for "spring", *<i>virъ</i>, in reference to the spring near Put Mula. <br/>
                <a name="Vuka" class="map">Vuka</a> (the river) &lt; *welk (moisture, the change from syllabic 'l' to 'u' is regular in Croatian). The name was attested as <i>Ulcae</i> on Tabula Peutingeriana. The names such as <a class="map">Vukovar</a>, <a class="map">Vučica</a> and <a class="map">Vučedol</a> share the same root.<br/>
                So, assuming those etymologies are true, it is, of course, possible to deduce quite a few things about the Illyrian grammar (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('ostali')">show/hide details</a>).<br/>

                    Here is what Dubravka Ivsic told me about some other toponyms I've attempted to interpret on this web-page:
                    <span class="quotation" lang="hr">
                        Poštovani g. Samaržija,<br/>
                        hvala Vam na mailu. Otvorila sam Vašu stranicu, no nažalost sada nisam
                        u mogućnosti detaljno se baviti time. Ipak, nekoliko usputnih
                        napomena. Toponimi poput Kalnik, Paklenica, Plitvice ipak jesu
                        slavenskoga podrijetla (za korijene usp. kal, paklina, plit-ak), Essek
                        je jednostavno mađarski izgovor hrvatskoga Osijek, a toponim Jozinci
                        puno je vjerojatnije izvoditi od osobnog imena Jozo nego
                        pretpostavljati "ilirski" *Iasona. Toponim Mariniana sasvim se lijepo
                        da izvesti kao predijalni toponim, (rimskoga podrijetla), od osobnog
                        imena Marinius.  Problem s pojmom "ilirski" je taj što se u njega
                        trpaju svi predslavenski toponimi na našem tlu koji nisu latinskog i
                        grčkog podrijetla, a mogu se izvesti od nekih praindoeuropskih
                        korijena. No, većina tih etimologija je "ad hoc", t.j. nema se s čime
                        usporediti. Osim toga, "ilirski" toponimi su k nama dospjeli kroz
                        latinski ili grčki filtar, pa mi zapravo ne znamo koji je bio njihov
                        izvorni lik. Zbog toga ne možemo biti sigurni niti kako treba
                        analizirati toponime, npr. Vaša analiza An-da-ut-on- ili ipak
                        An-daut-on-ia. Zato u istraživanju toponima predslavenskoga podrijetla
                        treba biti iznimno oprezan, a metodološki ispravan početak svakako je
                        analiza povijesnih potvrda toponima. O mnogima od tih problema pisala
                        sam u svojoj disertaciji, a upućujem Vas i na stariju literaturu o
                        ilirskom (Krahe i Mayer).<br/><br/>

		<a name="birthday"></a>A question I often get asked is how I know I'm not a victim of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday Paradox</a>, that it's not that the toponyms came from unrelated languages, and that the apparent patterns I see, although they seem unlikely at the first sight, have arisen randomly because such patterns are actually bound to occur. You can see (or hide) my response by clicking <a href="javascript:void()" onclick="toggle('program');setCodeToAppropriateWidth();">here</a>.<br/>
                <span id="program" style="display:none">So, one of the most striking patterns I see in Croatian toponyms is that 6 river names start with k(+vowel)+r: <a class="map" data-look="Krka+river,+Hrvatska">Krka</a> (once in Croatia, and <a class="map" data-look="Krka+river,+Slovenia">once</a> in Slovenia, but near Croatia), <a class="map">Korana</a>, <a class="map">Karašica</a> (2 rivers with the same name, both in Croatia), <a class="map">Krapina</a>, <a class="map">Krbavica</a> and <a class="map">Kravaršćica</a>. So, since there are around 20 consonants in a language, there are around 20*20=400 possible consonant pairs for a river name to begin with. While not all consonants in a language occur equally often, an average language has slightly more than 20 consonants, so we can assume those two errors approximately offset each other out. Let's assume there are around 100 river names in Croatia (it's a safe assumption, since many river names both repeat themselves and have obvious Slavic roots, so they don't count here). What's the probability the same consonant pair will appear 5 times if the names were really random? Let me be clear, we are not asking what's the probability that this particular pattern of k(+vowel)+r would appear in the river names, we are asking what's the probability that any such pattern would appear. This is the equivalent of asking: If you randomly choose a number between 1 and 400, 100 times, what's the probability you will choose the same number <i>n</i> times? So, because of the Birthday Paradox, it's indeed hard to calculate that probability analytically, but I've made a computer program that estimates that numerically. Here it goes in the C programming language (my favorite compiler for C is <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">TCC</a>, by the way, but this program is also easy to compile to JavaScript by Emscripten, you can see it done <a href="birthday.html">here</a> (<i>UPDATE on 22/01/2022: I have written <a href="birthday_paradox">a better version of that program in my programming language</a>.</i>)):

}
</span>
                    So, that program estimates the probability of there being a consonant pair appearing at the beginning of the river names <i>number_of_repeats</i> times, where <i>number_of_repeats</i> is entered on the keyboard.<img id="graph" src="Graph.png" alt="The probability of there appearing to be a common two-consonant prefix in certain number of rivers falls rapidly." style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom: 5px; width:50%;"/> The result will vary depending on how many times that program is being run, but it will always be approximately the same. So, here are some example sessions:
<span class="code">1
100.000000</span>
Because the probability of some consonant pair appearing at the beginning of the river names at least once is, by definition, 100% (unless we assume there is a language in which river names are made only of vowels).
<span class="code">2
100.000000</span>
That's because of the Birthday Paradox, although at the first glance it might seem unlikely that some consonant pair appears two times, the probability of that happening is very close to 100%.
<span class="code">3
56.779999
</span>
So, the probability of there being any consonant pair repeating three times is significantly lower than it repeating two times.
<span class="code">4
5.070000
</span>
So, the probability of there being a consonant pair repeating 4 times is only marginally statistically significant.
<span class="code">5
0.260000</span>
The probability of there being any consonant pair repeating itself 5 times at the beginning of 100 random river names is significantly less than 1 percent.<br/>
Taking there to be 6 or 7 such river names might be unfair, because the names of the two rivers named <a class="map">Karašica</a> are exactly the same and it's possible that one was named after the other, and there is a rather plausible Croatian-language etymology for the river name <a class="map">Kravaršćica</a> (that it comes from the Croatian word for cow, <i>krava</i>, itself from the Celtic word meaning <i>horned one</i>, presumably accepted into Croatian because it rhymes with the Croatian word for grass, <i>trava</i>, and cows at the time were fed almost exclusively with grass). Otherwise, the probability of there being a consonant pair repeating itself six times in random river names is so low the program can't estimate it:
<span class="code">6
0.000000</span>
So, the P-value of that pattern is indeed astoudingly low, less than 1/10000. <del>I can not only claim that, if those river names come from the same language, there was a word <i>*kar~kur</i> meaning "to flow" with nearly 100% certainty, I can also claim they do come from the same language with nearly 100% certainty.</del> (<i>UPDATE: That is a very simplistic model that gives wildly incorrect results in this case, see the <a href="#correction">correction</a> for more information.</i>)<br/>The probabilities of some other patterns I found are indeed harder to model<del>, but I expect their P-values to be similarly low</del>.<br/>
The most serious objection I get to this argument is that I am underestimating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman's effect</a> (the effect, discovered back in 1951, that it's hard for a computer to encypher texts in human languages, but that it's easy for a computer to <a href="huffman.html">compress</a> them, because some letters occur way more commonly than others). You can see my response my clicking <a href="javascript:void()" onclick="toggle('huffman')">here</a>.<br/>
<span id="huffman" style="display: none">The Huffman effect is caused partly by morphology, partly by phonology, and partly by syntax. In toponyms, we can ignore the effects of morphology and syntax.

</span>The program will take some 10 seconds to execute on a modern computer. If you put a long English text in the file <i>text.txt</i>, it prints that the probability of choosing the same consonant two times in a row equals 1/11, and that the most common consonant in English is <i>t</i> (presumably because of the meaningless words that need to be there because of the English syntax, such as <i>the</i>, <i>it</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>than</i>...). Yet, if you eliminate the syntax of the language, by putting a spell-checker word-list instead of a text in the file <i>text.txt</i>, it prints that the probability of choosing the same consonant two times in a row is 1/13, and that the most common consonant in that word list is <i>r</i> (presumably because of the extremely common English prefix <i>re-</i> and the even more common English suffix <i>-er</i>). I hope you see why I think that, if you eliminate both the morphology and syntax, the letter frequency will become quite uniform. And the same goes for Croatian: the probability of choosing the same consonant two times in a row in a Croatian text is 1/13, and the probability of choosing the same consonant in a Croatian word-list is 1/14 (in both cases, the most common consonant is <i>n</i>, presumably because of the common Croatian prefixes). For German, the respective probabilities are 1/12 in a text and 1/15 in a word-list, and the most common consonant is again <i>n</i> in both cases. For Italian, the respective probabilities are 1/12.5 for a long text and 1/15 in a word-list. In Italian, the most common consonant in a word-list is <i>r</i>, whereas the most common consonant in a long text is <i>n</i>. For French, the probability for a long text is 1/10, and the most common consonant in it is 's'. For French word-list, the probability is 1/11, and the most common consonant is again 's'. I have made a <a href="#table_with_collision_entropy">table with this data</a>. It is slightly amazing to me the entropy of the syntax of the German language is bigger than the entropy of the syntax of the English language, because I have always thought German syntax was simpler, but that is what the data shows. I have started <a href="https://www.forum.hr/showthread.php?p=90394567">a thread on forum.hr</a> about that. It's indeed hard to measure the effects of phonology, <del>but you can see why I think that we are not very far off if we assume the probability will be around 1/20</del> (<i>UPDATE: This is very misleading, as this assumes phonotactics plays no role in determining the entropy of the language, when, in reality, it plays a giant role. See <a href="#correction">correction</a> for more details.</i>). However, even if it is closer to 1/15, it would not matter much, since the p-value of this pattern with <i>*karr~kurr</i> would then be 18/10'000, still very significant.<br/>
Another objection I think I am likely to get is that I am ignoring the fact that previous consonants in a word affect the likelihood of what will be the next consonant in that word, that human languages are Markov Chain with respect to this. While that plays some role, <del>I think it is unlikely to play a crucial role</del>. Here is a JavaScript (<a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>) program I used to measure that effect (<i>UPDATE: That program assumes that the relevant entropy, also known as the collision entropy, is the same as the Shannon's entropy. In this case, those two entropies are very different. Again, see the <a href="#correction">correction</a> for a more detailed explanation.</i>):

That program printed 229, which is greater than 15<sup>2</sup>. And, of course, that program does not deal with common prefixes and suffixes in Croatian, so I'd expect that the actual inverse probability of a particular pair of two consonants appearing by chance is significantly higher than 229. A good question would be how the result could possible be grater than 15<sup>2</sup>, when the entropy of a consonant in Croatian is measured to be log<sub>2</sub>(14). Is it possible that the phonotactics somehow increases the entropies of human languages, rather than decreasing them (like the syntax seems to do)? I will be honest, I do not know the answer. Another weird thing I have noticed is that <a href="#huffman_in_javascript">the following program in JavaScript</a> measures entropy to be significantly higher (for example, claiming that the entropy of consonants in an English consonants being log<sub>2</sub>(14) rather than log<sub>2</sub>(11)) than <a href="#huffman_code">the program in C</a> which I thought would output the same result:

<del>I do not know if linguistics today can explain what is going on here.</del> (Actually, ti can, that is the difference between the Shannon's entropy and the collision entropy) But, like I have said, while there are unknowns, <del>I see no reason to think this pattern of a pair of two consonants repeating again and again at the beginning of the names of rivers will be expected, or even remotely likely</del> (<i>UPDATE: While it is not expected, or even likely to happen, it is not extremely unlikely to happen. After a bit more research, I concluded the probability of that happening is around 5.9%, and you can see why <a href="#correction">in the correction</a> at the bottom of the page.</i>). Anyway, in case you want to study the issue further, I have made an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index">Octave</a> program that measures the relationships between the results that my algorithm for estimating entropy gives with the results that the Shannon's algorithm gives (<b>WARNING</b>: The program outputs incorrect results if run in Octave and it causes a syntax error in MatLab, see <a href="#correction">this correction</a> for more details):

                Here are the
                sound changes I propose happened from Proto-Indo-European to
                Illyrian:<br/>
                [k<sup>w</sup>]&gt;k<br/>
                [k<sup>j</sup>]m&gt;y<br/>
                [k<sup>j</sup>]&gt;k<br/>
                [b<sup>h</sup>]a&gt;p<br/>
                [b<sup>h</sup>]&gt;β<br/>
                [g<sup>j</sup>]&gt;gh<br/>
                [l]s&gt;s<br/>
                [n]s&gt;s<br/>
                [m]r&gt;b<br/>
                [ew]&gt;i<br/>
                [ey]&gt;i<br/>
                [e]rC&gt;i<br/>
                C[l]C&gt;il (perhaps not between all consonants)<br/>
                0[H]C&gt;e<br/>
                So,
                because of the epenthetic vowel 'e' appearing only in the first
                syllable (Ervenica), I suggest that the stress was always on the first syllable.
                I also have a temptation to think that the nominative singular
                actually ended in -i in Illyrian. The suffix -i- is seen in,
                for instance, Serapia, Krndija,
                Colapis, and possibly also in Andautonia. I believe that the primary
                ablaut changed from e/o in PIE to a/u in Illyrian, for instance,
                in the toponyms such as Mursa, Marsonia and Mariniana. The geminates (long consonants, they don't exist in English, but they existed in Latin and were written as double consonants) in
                the toponyms such as Issa and Pannonia are probably explicable by
                some consonants being doubled after a short vowel, like in Middle English
                more or less. It's not quite clear what sound changes the Proto-Indo-European syllabic 'l'
                (and therefore probably other syllabic consonants) had undergone. It appears to have been
                retained after a 'w' (Vuka, Ulciria), but not after a 'd' (Dilj), where it appears to
                have been turned into 'il'. The 'e' turning to 'i' if followed by r+consonant was happening
                in the very late stages of Illyrian, the name <i>C<b>e</b>rtissia</i> is attested in the Antonine Itinerary as
                <i>C<b>i</b>rtisia</i>, and the name <i>S<b>i</b>rmium</i> is attested by Polemius Sylvius as <i>S<b>e</b>rmium</i>.
                The <i>g</i> sound, as far as I know, hasn't been attested in any Illyrian name (apart from Pliny having written the ancient name for <a class="map">Pag</a>, <i>Cissa</i>, as <i>Gissa</i>, in <i>Naturalis Historia</i> book 3 chapter 25), and it's possible all the Proto-Indo-European velars merged into one sound. However, this is, among Indo-European languages, unattested, and is therefore unlikely, and the lack of <i>g</i> in attested words and names is probably a coincidence. I think the most common consonants in Illyrian were <i>s</i> and <i>l</i>, for the element <i>*sal~sol</i> appears in at least three meanings: something related to rivers (the ancient name for <a class="map">Jadro River</a> was <i>Sallia</i>, and there are three hydronyms <i>Zala</i> in Slovenia: one is the river that flows from the <a class="map" data-look="Szalafo,+Hungary">Fekete To</a> lake on the border with Hungary, one is the river with the waterfall called <a class="map" data-look="Kotel+Waterfall,+Slovenia">Kotel</a>, and one is a stream near <a class="map" data-look="Železniki,+Slovenia">Železniki</a>), in the word probably meaning exactly "island" (attested in ancient name for <a class="map">Šolta</a>, <i>Solenta</i>, in all likelihood related to the Latvian word <i>sala</i> meaning <i>island</i>), and in the word meaning "salty", attested in the ancient name for the Messapian salt lake <a class="map" data-look="Saline+di+Margherita+di+Savoia">Salpi</a>, <i>Salapia</i>, and perhaps in the toponym <a class="map">Sali</a> near the <a class="map">salt lake Mir</a>. I think the word <i>*sal</i> in the meaning <i>river</i> is a borrowing from Pelasgian, because one of the ancient names for the river <a class="map" data-look="Peneus+river,+Greece">Peneus</a> in Greece was <i>Σαλαμβριας</i>. It's likely that, under some conditions, Indo-European *s turned to the <i>ʃ</i> (<i>sh</i> in <i>ship</i>) sound in Illyrian, because Pseudo-Scylax wrote the name <i>Solenta</i> as <i>Holynta</i>, and it's a lot more likely somebody would hear the <i>ʃ</i> sound as <i>h</i> than the <i>s</i> sound as <i>h</i>. However, since neither Latin alphabet nor the Greek alphabet had a letter for the <i>ʃ</i> sound, it's hard to tell under what conditions Illyrian <i>s</i> turned to <i>ʃ</i>.<br/>
                So, here is what I think <a href="http://linguistforum.com/linguist%27s-lounge/pater-noster-in-proto-indo-european/">Pater Noster</a> might have sounded like in Illyrian:<br/>

		Just to be clear, I think it is unlikely any single sentence there is actually valid Illyrian. I also think it is way more likely that "<i lang="ett" style="font-family: Times;">𐌓𐌀𐌔𐌄𐌍𐌀𐌋&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌖𐌓𐌔𐌌𐌉𐌍𐌉&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌋𐌖𐌐𐌖𐌂𐌄&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌇𐌀𐌍𐌕𐌉&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌆𐌀𐌈𐌓𐌖𐌌&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌅𐌏𐌛&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌀𐌅𐌉𐌋𐌀𐌓𐌉&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌍𐌀𐌍𐌀𐌕𐌍𐌀𐌌&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌉𐌍𐌂&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌇𐌀𐌌𐌈𐌉𐌍</i>" <sup><a href="#etruscan_letters_warning">[note]</a></sup> (transliterated: "<i lang="ett"><abbr title="Etruscan">Rasenal</abbr> <abbr title="military command, speech, (perhaps) language">ursmini</abbr> <abbr title="died">lupuce</abbr> <abbr title="before, (perhaps) ago">hanti</abbr> <abbr title="twenty">zaθrum</abbr> <abbr title="hundred">vor</abbr> <abbr title="years (locative plural)">avilari</abbr> <abbr title="and nobody">nanatnam</abbr> <abbr title="it">inc</abbr> <abbr title="understands">hamθin</abbr>.</i>") is <a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/15564/how-would-you-say-the-etruscan-language-died-two-thousand-years-ago-and-nobody">valid</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/mor62e/how_would_you_say_the_etruscan_language_died_two/">Etruscan</a> for "<i>The Etruscan language died two thousand (twenty hundreds) years ago and nobody understands it.</i>" and that &quot;<i lang="ett" style="font-family: Times;">𐌆𐌀𐌋&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌕𐌄𐌕𐌉𐌍𐌀𐌓&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌂𐌋𐌄𐌓𐌉&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌀𐌌&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌌𐌄𐌅𐌄𐌋𐌂𐌄𐌀𐌓𐌉&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌔𐌖𐌌𐌉&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌄𐌓𐌉</i>&quot; (transliterated: &quot;<i lang="ett"><abbr title="two">Zal</abbr> <abbr title="coverings, clothes, (perhaps) shoes (nominative plural)">tetinar</abbr> <abbr title="those (always coming after the group of words it is modifying)">cleri</abbr> <abbr title="(they) are">am</abbr> <abbr title="small (locative plural)">mevelceari</abbr> <abbr title="feet (locative, semantically plural but morphologically singular)">sumi</abbr> <abbr title="for (postposition requiring locative)">eri</abbr>.</i>&quot;) is also <a href="https://qr.ae/pGeo8F">proper</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClenarSecharkaRasnal/comments/pgfmg8/were_etruscan_words_such_as_avil_year_and_sum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">Etruscan</a> for &quot;<i>Those two shoes are for small feet.</i>&quot; than any of those sentences are likely to be valid Illyrian. To give you some context, most Etruscan dictionaries do not speculate on what the Etruscan word for <i>hundred</i> might have been. However, Marcus Terentius Varro wrote in <i>De Re Rustica</i> in the 1st book in the 10th chapter that, for telling distance, in the language spoken in Campania, they use a measurement unit called <i lang="ett">vorsum</i>, which in their language means <i>hundred feet</i> (<i>centum pedes</i>), because <i lang="ett">vor</i> means <i>hundred</i> and <i lang="ett">sum</i> means <i>feet</i>. It is not clear from the context what is that language spoken in Campania, I guessed it was Etruscan. But, for all we know, it may have very well been Illyrian. I mean, I would, of course, expect the Illyrian word for <i>hundred</i> to have been something along the lines of <i>kimton</i>, rather than <i>vor</i>, but, obviously, I do not know that. And, needless to say, it is also possible that <i>vorsum</i> did not mean exactly <i>hundred feet</i> in any language and that Varro was mistaken. You know as they say, if an etymology was suggested before the middle of the 19th century, it is probably wrong. I find it way more likely that "<i lang="ett">𐌍𐌀𐌂​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌀𐌅𐌉𐌋​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌐𐌖𐌋𐌖𐌌𐌙𐌅𐌀​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌚𐌀𐌋𐌀𐌕𐌖𐌋​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌔𐌍𐌖𐌉𐌀𐌘​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌀𐌂𐌀​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌓𐌀𐌔𐌍𐌀𐌋​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌀𐌌𐌖𐌂𐌄​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌆𐌉𐌅​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌍𐌀𐌍𐌀𐌕𐌍𐌀𐌌​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌉𐌂𐌀​​&ZeroWidthSpace;⸱&ZeroWidthSpace;𐌂𐌍𐌀𐌓𐌀</i>" (transliterated: "<i lang="ett"><abbr title="for (time)">Nac</abbr> <abbr title="year; it goes in singular, as we can see in the phrase 'nac ci avil', 'for three years', attested on Pyrgi Tablets">avil</abbr> <abbr title="stars; irregular plural (not with the suffix -ar-), attested also on Pyrgi Tablets">pulumχva</abbr> <abbr title="of the sky">falatul</abbr> <abbr title="as numerous; the phrase 'pulumχva snuiaφ' meaning 'as numerous as stars' is attested on Pyrgi Tablets">snuiaφ</abbr>, <abbr title="voice, (perhaps) language">aca</abbr> <abbr title="Etruscan">Rasnal</abbr> <abbr title="has been">amuce</abbr> <abbr title="dead">ziv</abbr>, <abbr title="and nobody">nanatnam</abbr> <abbr title="it">ica</abbr> <abbr title="knows">cnara</abbr>.</i>") is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/mor62e/comment/i751f9w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">valid</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/uq2g2v/ima_li_ovdje_stručnjaka_za_etrurski_jezik/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">Etruscan</a> for "<i>The Etruscan language has been dead for years as numerous as the stars of heaven and nobody knows it.</i>". So, that <i>Illyrian text</i> was just an example of what I think Illyrian might have sounded like, phonologically.<br/>
		One thing I think we can be somewhat certain about are the names of numbers 1-10 in Illyrian. Here is what I think they sounded like:
		<table>
			<tr><td>1</td><td>*inos</td></tr>
			<tr><td>2</td><td>*do</td></tr>
			<tr><td>3</td><td>*tris</td></tr>
			<tr><td>4</td><td>*kettores</td></tr>
			<tr><td>5</td><td>*penka</td></tr>
			<tr><td>6</td><td>*seks</td></tr>
			<tr><td>7</td><td>*septim</td></tr>
			<tr><td>8</td><td>*oktu</td></tr>
			<tr><td>9</td><td>*ennun</td></tr>
			<tr><td>10</td><td>*dekkim</td></tr>
		</table>
		Of those, I consider the word for 5, "<i>penka</i>", to be the most certain, as it is attested as "<i>penkaheh</i>" (-<i>heh</i> presumably being a grammatical suffix) on some inscriptions.

                That would be it! If you want to discuss my theory, go to the "Croatian Toponyms" forum thread I've linked to on the left. I'd like to have some sane opposition there, because I think my interpretation may be right. Ideas are correct or incorrect independent of their creators. The fact that I am not a linguist specializing in those things doesn't mean my ideas are wrong. <del>I've used the methods that are well-accepted in linguistics (apart from applying statistics to the toponyms, which is for some reason very rarely done), I've just come to the conclusions that are different from the mainstream ones.</del> (<i>UPDATE: I think <a href="#methodology">this paragraph I have written on Discord</a> is a good explanation for how my methods differ from the mainstream ones, and why I think mine are better.</i>)<br/>
If you have a proposal parallel to mine, I think it should address at least the following three things:
<ol style="padding-left:30px;">
<li>Why do almost no toponyms in Croatia make sense to people speaking Croatian? An obvious answer seems to be that most toponyms in Croatia don't come from Croatian, but from some unattested substrate language that died relatively recently. It's fine if, in your proposal, you explain some toponyms using Slavic roots that don't exist (or have changed meaning) in modern Croatian. But if you do that again and again, then your proposal is unlikely.</li>
<li>Why does this <i>k-r</i> pattern repeat in the Croatian river names? Either provide some explanation for that pattern (like, in my proposal, that *<i>karr~kurr</i> meant "<i>to flow</i>" in the substrate language) or provide some mathematical model of the language that says that pattern is not statistically significant. A crude birthday calculation (assuming the language has 20*20=400 equally likely consonant pairs) suggests the probability of that pattern occurring by chance is around 1/10'000. A birthday calculation that takes into account the collision entropy of the consonant pairs in the Croatian language suggests that the probability is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17. Maybe an even better model would suggest it is not actually statistically significant. Now, I do not see that. While you can perhaps dismiss most of my alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia as baseless speculation, you cannot dismiss my measurements and calculations showing that this k-r pattern is statistically significant the same way. Crude birthday calculations suggest that we should expect 3 rivers in Croatia to accidentally start with the same two-consonant prefix. While you can push that number to 5 by adjusting those birthday calculations for the collision entropy of the phonology (including phonotactics) of the Croatian language, you cannot push it to 7 (Krka, Korana, Krapina, Kravar&scaron;&ccaron;ica, Krbavica, 2*Kara&scaron;ica) that way. You need to explain it somehow differently. What I am <b>not</b> open for are phonosemantic explanations, explanations which contradict the basic principles of linguistics. I realize language is not the same as math, but, in order to study it scientifically, we need to have some sort of rigour. If p-values turn out to be so useful in natural sciences, why not try to apply them here?<br/>
	I am also not open for blatant ad-hoc hypotheses: inventing reasons why an experiment wouldn't work without providing evidence supporting those reasons. You respond to an experiment with an experiment, not with speculation. If you are going to claim, for example, that my measurements and calculations are misleading because the nouns in the Croatian language have a significantly lower collision entropy than the rest of the words in the Aspell word-list, be prepared to provide evidence for that claim.</li>
<li>If you are going to propose Latin etymologies, make sure they do not contradict the sound laws that applied when borrowing from Late Latin into Old Croatian. Realize that, for example, <b>long</b> <i>i</i> (not short, as somebody who knows the basics of Croatian historical phonology might expect) gets borrowed as front yer (like in the toponym <i>Cavtat</i>, from "<i>civitatem</i>", long '<i>i</i>' got borrowed as a front yer and changed to '<i>a</i>'), and that short '<i>i</i>' got regularly borrowed as a yat (like in the toponym <i>Srijem</i>, from the ancient name <i>Sirmium</i>). So don't, for example, try to explain an '<i>i</i>' in some toponym where a non-Ikavian dialect is spoken as being a borrowing from Latin '<i>i</i>'. If you are going to propose that Croatian toponyms come from some other language, propose the sound laws and stick to them. Once again, I realize that language is not the same as math, but, in order to scientifically study it, we need to have some sort of rigour.<br/>
	I would suggest you to also read the end of <a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/46824/20821">this StackExchange answer by Janus Bahs Jacquet</a>, where he speculates how it is that Latin 'o' in the toponyms doesn't get borrowed as 'o' in Croatian.<br/>
	And understand that knowledge of historical phonology means very little if you are constantly dodging around the historical phonology by asserting recent borrowings or, worse yet, inventing unattested languages with sound changes that you would like. <a href="#dodging_around_historical_phonology">Mainstream linguistics seems to do that a lot</a>.</li>
</ol>
I hope I do not sound too harsh, but all the proposals I am familiar with except mine do not address even one of those issues (especially not the first two).</div>

Namely, there was a syntax error in my program. MatLab refused to parse it, but Octave was apparently doing automatic semicolon insertion (like JavaScript engines are doing). That resulted in incorrect test strings in <code>testni_stringovi</code>. This is what the test strings look like in <a href="matlab.csv">MatLab when exported to a CSV file</a>, and this is what they look like when <a href="octave.csv">exported from Octave</a>.<br/>
	      Anyway, since we know the number of possible consonant pairs in Croatian is 26*26=676, the maximal possible entropy a consonant pair in the Croatian language could have is log<sub>2</sub>(676)=9.4 bits/symbol. And we have measured the Shannon's entropy to be log<sub>2</sub>(229)=7.839. So, assuming the curve representing the relationship between the Samaržija's entropy and the Shannon's entropy does not change its shape between individual consonants and consonants pairs, but only scales uniformly (which I have no idea how to test), we can estimate the Samaržija's entropy of the consonant pairs in the Croatian language the following way. We can assume the entropy of the pairs of consonants is log<sub>2</sub>(676)/log<sub>2</sub>(21)=2.14 times bigger than the corresponding entropy of individual consonants. The ratio between the measured Shannon's entropy and the maximal possible entropy in this case is 7.839/9.4=0.834. Thus, the corresponding point on the curve on the above diagram is when the Shannon's entropy is equal to 0.834*log<sub>2</sub>(21)=3.663 bits/symbol. The Samaržija's entropy at that point, as can be read from the diagram, is around 2.8 bits/symbol. Thus, we can expect the Samaržija's entropy of the pairs of consonants in Croatian to be around 2.14*2.8=5.992 bits/symbol. Thus, the probability of two random words beginning with the same pair of consonants should be around 1/(2^5.992)=1/63.65=1.57%. If that is true, then the p-value of that pattern of the Croatian river names starting with <i>*karr~kurr</i> is only 5.9% (the highest estimate I got by running the <a href="#birthday">birthday-paradox-calculation written in C</a> a few times), rather than around 1/500. Well, I guess it is always like that in social sciences: If you think you have a good p-value, you are probably calculating something incorrectly.<br/>
	      Of course, whether that is a correct estimate for the p-value depends on where the entropy of the language goes. If it is mostly syntax and morphology that decreases the entropy of the language, then those decreases in entropy do not matter in toponyms borrowed from an ancient language. Only if those decreases in entropy come from the phonology, they do matter. See the paper I linked below for a lengthy discussion about that, including my attempts to estimate which parts of the grammar are responsible for how much decrease of entropy.<br/><br/>

<span class="quotation" lang="hr">Poštovani Teo,<br/>
hvala Vam na Vašem mailu i interesu za predslavensku toponimiju.<br/>
Sinkronijski gledano, ime Karašica je slavensko, s obzirom na to da je izvedeno slavenskim sufiksom -ica. Pitanje je odakle je osnova (karas- ili karaš-), no to ne mijenja prvu činjenicu (isto kao što je npr. Jurica ime izvedeno hrvatskim sufiksom od osnove grčkoga podrijetla, pa ga to čini hrvatskim imenom). Koliko sam upoznata, hidronim Karašica prvi put je zabilježen tek u 17. st., na mađarskom se zove Karassó. Želite li doista poštivati znanstvenu metodologiju, trebalo bi prikupiti povijesne potvrde hidronima Karašica (iz pisanih izvora i sa starih karata) te utvrditi koji je najstariji oblik. S obzirom na to da dunavska Karašica teče i kroz Mađarsku, za nju u obzir dolazi i da je u mađarski ime posuđeno iz hrvatskog i obrnuto, iz hrvatskog u mađarski. Također, osnova karaš- plodna je i drugim toponimima (i izvan Hrvatske), pa bi trebalo utvrditi i jesu li svi oni povezani, tj. je li riječ o istoj onomastičkoj osnovi.<br/>
Formalno gledajući, nema prepreka da bi hidronim Karašica bio izveden od naziva ribe <i>karas</i> ili <i>karaš</i> (taj naziv se ne odnosi samo na zlatnu ribicu), a dublje podrijetlo naziva ribe u ovom slučaju nije relevantno za hidronim (slično kao što je i Krapina najvjerojatnije izvedeno od naziva ribe krap).<br/>
Što se tiče ostalih navedenih rijeka koje u svojim imenima sadrže k-r: Krka bi doista moglo biti predslavensko ime, Korana je nesigurnoga podrijetla, Krbavica je izvedeno od Krbava, a Kravarščica je izvedeno od Kravarsko (što je izvedeno od <i>kravar</i>).<br/>
Indoeuropski korijen koji spominjete rekonstruira se kao *k(')ers- sa značenjem '<i>trčati</i>', a postoje mišljenja da se od njega u germanskim jezicima razvila riječ za konja. Indoeuropska riječ za konja rekonstruira se kao  *h<sub>1</sub>ek'u-.
Argument koji počinjete s „mnogi ilirski natpisi počinju s“ potpuno je promašen, s obzirom na to da ne postoje natpisi pisani „ilirskim jezikom“.<br/>
Matematičke metode u lingvistici mogu biti korisne u nekim slučajevima, no one ne mogu zamijeniti klasične lingvističke metode. U povijesnoj toponimiji nema prečaca.<br/>
Srdačan pozdrav,<br/>

Anyway, what do you think, who is really being more scientific here? Is it me, who has attempted to measure collision entropy of different parts of the Croatian grammar and has done numerical calculations showing the probability of that <i>k-r</i> pattern occurring by chance is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17? Or is it her, who makes arguments from silence (that the name <i>Karašica</i> is unlikely to date back to antiquity because of its late first known attestation in the 17th century; that is also historically inaccurate, <a href="http://szemlelapszamok.adatbank.transindex.ro/szemle_lapszamok/1925_1-2/005Melich%20Janos_ketretegu.pdf">the name <i>Karašica</i> is first mentioned</a> in a document from the year 1228 together with a dubious piece of information that it used to be called <i>Mogioros</i> in antiquity; Even if it were true, it would be much like saying Marco Polo has not really been to China because he did not mention the Great Wall or tea), does some intricate theoretical reasoning overshadowing my experimental results (like the contemporary response to the Ignaz Semmelweis experiment showing that puerperal fever was caused almost exclusively by uncleanliness), and asserts that traditional methods are superior to mathematical methods? <br/>
By the way, the etymology she suggests is obviously problematic not only because of informatics, but also because of the earliest attestations: the earliest attestation of the river name <i>Kara&scaron;ica</i> is <i>Karassou</i>, without the Slavic suffix <i>-ica</i>. Clearly, it had a non-Slavic suffix back then, so no Slavic etymology is plausible.

UPDATE on 18/12/2021: I have made a <a href="Karasica.ppt">LibreOffice presentation about my alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia</a>.<br/><br/>
UPDATE on 26/12/2021: I have written a <a href="https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=70713.180#msg2341513">short summary of the ideas presented in the presentation</a>:
<span class="quotation" id="english_summary">
To summarize, I think that I have thought of a way to measure the collision entropy of different parts of the grammar, and that it is possible to calculate the p-values of certain patterns in the names of places using them. The entropy of the syntax can obviously be measured by measuring the entropy of spell-checker word list such as that of Aspell and subtracting from that an entropy of a long text in the same language (I was measuring only for the consonants, I was ignoring the vowels, because vowels were not important for what I was trying to calculate). I got that, for example, the entropy of the syntax of the Croatian language is log2(14)-log2(13)=0.107 bits per symbol, that the entropy of the syntax of the English language is log2(13)-log2(11)=0.241 bits per symbol, and that the entropy of the syntax of the German language is log2(15)-log2(12)=0.3219 bits per symbol. It was rather surprising to me that the entropy of the syntax of the German language is larger than the entropy of the syntax of the English language, given that German syntax seems simpler (it uses morphology more than the English language does, somewhat simplifying the syntax), but you cannot argue with the hard data. It looks as though the collision entropy of the syntax and the complexity of the syntax of the same language are not strongly correlated. The entropy of the phonotactics of a language can, I guess, be measured by measuring the entropy of consonant pairs (with or without a vowel inside them) in a spell-checker wordlist, then measuring the entropy of single consonants in that same wordlist, and then subtracting the former from the latter multiplied by two. I measured that the entropy of phonotactics of the Croatian language is 2*log2(14)-5.992=1.623 bits per consonant pair. That 5.992 bits per consonant pair has been calculated using some mathematically dubious method involving the Shannon Entropy (As, back then, I didn't know that there is a simple way to calculate the collision entropy as the negative binary logarithm of the sum of the squares of relative frequencies of symbols, I was measuring the collision entropy using the Monte Carlo method. The Shannon entropy is 7.839 bits per consonant pair, and the maximal possible entropy is log2(26*26) bits per consonant pair, so I suppose the collision entropy is around 5.992 bits per consonant pair.). Now, I have taken the entropy of the phonotactics to be the lower bound of the entropy of the phonology, that is the only entropy that matters in ancient toponyms (entropy of the syntax and morphology do not matter then, because the toponym is created in a foreign language). Given that the Croatian language has 26 consonants, the upper bound of the entropy of morphology, which does not matter when dealing with ancient toponyms, can be estimated as log2(26*26)-1.623-2*0.107-5.992=1.572 bits per pair of consonants. So, to estimate the p-value of the pattern that many names of rivers in Croatia begin with the consonants 'k' and 'r' (Karašica, Krka, Korana, Krbavica, Krapina and Kravarščica), I have done some birthday calculations, first setting the simulated entropy of phonology to be 1.623 bits per consonant pair, and the second by setting the simulated entropy of phonology to be 1.623+1.572=3.195 bits per consonant pair (In other words, in the second birthday calculation, I assumed the entropy of morphology was 0). In both of those birthday calculations, I assumed that there are 100 different river names in Croatia. The former birthday calculation gave me the probability of that k-r-pattern occuring by chance to be 1/300 and the latter gave me the probability 1/17. So the p-value of that k-r-pattern is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17. Mainstream linguistics considers that k-r pattern in Croatian river names to be a coincidence, but nobody before me (as far as I know) has even attempted to calculate how much of a coincidence it would have to be (the p-value). So I concluded that the simplest explanation is that the river names Karašica, Krka, Korana, Krbavica, Krapina and Kravarščica are related and all come from the Indo-European root *kjers meaning horse (in Germanic languages) or to run (in Celtic and Italic languages). I think the Illyrian word for "flow" came from that root, and that the Illyrian word for "flow" was *karr or *kurr, the vowel difference 'a' to 'u' perhaps being dialectical variation (compare the attested Illyrian toponyms Mursa and Marsonia, the names Mursa and Marsonia almost certainly come from the same root, but there is a vowel difference 'a' to 'u' in them). Furthermore, based on the historical phonology of the Croatian language and what's known about the Illyrian language (for example, that there was a suffix -issia, as in Certissia, the ancient name for Đakovo, but not the suffix -ussia), I reconstructed the Illyrian name for Karašica as either *Kurrurrissia (borrowed into Proto-Slavic as *Kъrъrьsьja, which would give *Karrasja after the Havlik's Law, and then *Karaša after the yotation and the loss of geminates, to which the Croatian suffix -ica was added) or *Kurrirrissia (borrowed into Proto-Slavic as *Kъrьrьsьja, which would also give *Karaša by regular sound changes), and the Illyrian name for Krapina as either *Karpona (borrowed into Proto-Slavic as *Korpyna, which would give "Krapina" after the merger of *y and *i and the metathesis of the liquids) or *Kurrippuppona (borrowed into Proto-Slavic as *Kъrьpъpyna, which would also give "Krapina" by regular sound changes), with preference to *Karpona. Do those arguments sound compelling to you?
</span>
Overall, I believe I've discovered three hard facts which will not be controversial:
<ol>
<li>The collision entropy of the syntax of some language and the complexity of the syntax of that same language are not strongly correlated. For example, German has around 30% higher collision entropy of the syntax than English does, in spite of arguably having a simpler syntax. It is hard to imagine there are other factors hiding such a correlation, as German and English are closely related languages.</li>
<li>Birthday Paradox does not remotely explain away that k-r pattern in the Croatian river names. A simple birthday calculation suggests that the probability of that k-r pattern occurring by chance is around 1/10'000.</li>
<li>Birthday Paradox plus the collision entropy of phonology (some pairs of consonants being way more common than others) also does not appear to explain away that k-r pattern. Birthday calculations adjusted for the measured collision entropy of phonology of the Croatian language suggest that the probability of that k-r pattern occurring by chance is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17.</li>
</ol>
I don't think those claims can reasonably be considered pure speculation. Of course, my paper contains plenty of speculation, including, but not limited, to this:
<br/>
<img src="ime_Karasica.jpg" style="width:100%;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px" alt="The reconstruction of the Illyrian name for Karašica."/>
<br/>
It's customary to include such speculation (although I wouldn't call it <i>pure speculation</i>) in papers about the names of places.

UPDATE on 06/01/2022: A lot of the responses I get on the Internet forums when I share my ideas boil down to &quot;<i>You should not use mathematics in this part of linguistics.</i>&quot;. Well, here is how I will respond to them:
<span class="quotation" lang="hr">Samo ti slijepo vjeruj da statistika i informatika nemaju ništa za reći o hrvatskim toponimima. Toliko ne znaš o informatici i statistici da poričeš da su one uopće korisne. To je onaj prvi stadij Dunning Krugerovog efekta, kad poričeš da je vještina korisna. Zapravo, ima bolji opis što se s tobom događa: ti si u poziciji Darwina kada je komentirao na Mendelov rad: "Matematika je u biologiji ono što je skalpel u stolarevoj radionici, nema tamo što tražiti.". Danas to zvuči smiješno. Zapravo, zaboravi, ti nisi ni na toj razini, ti si na razini onih što su poricali indoeuropsku lingvistiku zbog svoje slijepe vjere u priču o Kuli babilonskoj i da lingvistika nema ništa za reći o tome. I žao mi je što u 21. stoljeću ima ljudi koji tako razmišljaju, kao da ih posljednjih nekoliko stoljeća razvoja znanosti nisu ništa naučila. Nema prave znanosti bez statistike.</span>
		Whether or not my theories are correct, &quot;<i>You should not use mathematics in this part of linguistics.</i>&quot; is a ridiculous argument and deserves such a response.<br/>
I think that partly what is happening is that the users of Internet forums about linguistics are reading a lot of Wikipedia and other tertiary sources of information, while reading almost no primary and secondary scientific sources. Wikipedia and other tertiary sources of information (etymological dictionaries...) almost never discuss p-values. So, no wonder that discussions about p-values seem alien to the forum users, even though they are the foundation of the modern scientific method. It is unfortunate.
<br/><br/>
<span id="table_with_collision_entropy">UPDATE on 13/01/2022: Here is the table with the data about collision entropy of various languages, which I have measured for purposes of my experiment:</span>
<table>

One interesting question I get by examining that data is &quot;Does the deep orthography (such as English or French) decrease the collision entropy of a written language?&quot;.

);</span>This time, to calculate the collision entropy, instead of using the complicated algorithm that follows right from the definition (choose two symbols from the string randomly, check whether they are equal, and repeat that many times), I used a much simpler algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9nyi_entropy#Collision_entropy">described at Wikipedia</a>. I must admit my understanding of the issue has improved drastically.<br/><br/>
UPDATE on 23/03/2022: <a href="https://www.forum.hr/showpost.php?p=91719203&postcount=2">Here</a> is how I responded to somebody comparing me to theologians who try to use mathematics to prove the existence of God:
<div class="quotation" lang="hr">Mislim da, da je ontološki argument dobar, matematička logika bi bila izvrstan alat za dokazivanje postajanja Boga. Nažalost, ontološki argument zasniva se na dvije premise koje su u najmanju ruku veoma upitne:
<ol><li>Bog postoji u nekim mogućim svjetovima. Drugim rječima, paradoks svemoći i drugi a-priori argumenti protiv postojanja Boga nisu valjani.</li>
<li>Ono što je savršeno i postoji u nekim mogućim svjetovima postoji u svim mogućim svjetovima. To je upitno jer se, recimo, čini da savršeni krug postoji u nekim mogućim svjetovima, ali ne i u našemu.</li></ol>
Matematičkom logikom se eventualno može dokazati da postoji forma ontološkog argumenta koja je logički valjana, no to nam, zbog tih upitnih premisa, ne govori da Bog postoji. To jest, eventualno se matematičkom logikom može dokazati da Kant nije bio u pravu da je skrivena premisa svake forme ontološkog argumenta da je postojanje logički predikat, no to ne negira problem da su te dvije premise upitne.<br/>
Sve u svemu, problem ni s jednim oblikom ontološkog argumenta nije to da koristi matematičku logiku.</div><br/>

UPDATE on 18/06/2022: My informatics professor Anđelko Lišnjić suggested me that I make a <a href="frekvencije_parova_suglasnika.txt">table with the frequencies of consonant pairs in the Croatian language</a>. So I did that!<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE on 06/06/2023: What do people on the Internet think about my idea that the Croatian dialectism &quot;<i>regav</i>&quot; (full of cracks) and the Ancient Greek word &quot;<i>ῥαγή</i>&quot; (crack) are both loanwords from the Illyrian language? I have asked that question on <a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/q/21017/8533">Latin Language StackExchange</a> and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/croatian/comments/141r4ax/odakle_dolazi_dijalektizam_u_donjem_miholjcu_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">Reddit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE on 28/07/2023: The Reddit user called <i>neuralbeans</i> thinks that the central argument I presented in <a href="Karasica.doc">my latest paper about toponyms</a> (you can read <a href="#english_summary">an English-language summary here</a>) is flawed because maybe the nouns in the Croatian language have a significantly lower collision entropy than all the words in the Aspell spell-checking dictionary (and toponyms are nouns). If you ask me, that's an obvious ad-hoc hypothesis. Why would different word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives...) in the Croatian language have different collision entropies? I can see why they would have different collision entropies in the Swahili language, where, due to the noun classes, verbs can start in consonant pairs that nouns cannot, but I fail to see how it would be possible in the Croatian (or English) language. And why would nouns have lower collision entropy, rather than higher? Seems like a baseless ad-hoc hypothesis, doesn't it? And it's not a burden of proof on me to do some complicated experiment because of somebody's ad-hoc hypothesis. However, some people on other Internet forums think that it is a serious problem with my paper. So, I've started a question about that on <a href="https://www.forum.hr/showthread.php?p=99311279#post99311279">forum.hr</a> and on <a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/47201/20821">Linguistics StackExchange</a>, to see if somebody has researched that before me. Or perhaps if there is a way to test the <i>neuralbeans</i>'es hypothesis without spending days compiling a long list of nouns in the Croatian language.<br/>

UPDATE on 16/08/2023: I have tried to explain on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/333434240610074627/516064622210580480/1141057657487233104">Discord</a> how my methodology is different from the methodology of mainstream onomastics (part of linguistics that deals with names), and why I think my methodology is better:
<div id="methodology" class="quotation" lang="la">Ego censeo quia plurimi linguistae, cum student nomina locorum, utuntur methodologia quae contradicit informaticae. Principium fundamentale methodologiae, qua plurimi linguisti utuntur cum student nomina locorum, est quod etymologiae ex linguis quas scimus probabiliores sunt quam etymologiae ex linguis quas non scimus (ut lingua Illyrica). Ego cogito id principium non veritatem esse. Ego cogito pricipium gravius esse quod repetitio eorundem aut similium elementorum in aliquo significato (flumen, mons, fons...) significat quod nomina locorum veniunt ex eadem lingua. Exempli gratia, id regularitas quod primi duo consonantes in nominibus fluminum in Croatiae saepe sint 'k' et 'r'. Plurimi linguistae qui nominibus locorum in Croatia student censent eam regularitatem esse coincidentalem, sed informatica dicit quia probabilitas ut ea regularitas fit coincidentaliter sit inter 1/300 et 1/17. Id est parva probabilitas.</div>
The basic principle of the methodology of mainstream onomastics is that etymologies involving languages that we know a lot about are supposedly more probable than etymologies involving languages we know little about. The <a href="#hear_both_sides">Dubravka Ivšić'es response to an earlier version of my paper</a> wonderfully illustrates that. I don't think that principle is true, as I don't see why etymologies involving languages we know little about would be less probable. And assuming that gives explanations for the toponyms that are improbable according to the information theory (such as that the k-r pattern in the river names is a coincidence). And by "<i>improbable</i>" I mean that it is possible to calculate the probability and that it will be small.<br/>
That's not to say I fully understand the methodology of mainstream linguistics. Which methodology you have to follow so that it seems to you that the name "<i>Issa</i>" is certainly pre-Indo-European and that it doesn't occur to you that it is perhaps the Illyrian word for spring is truly beyond me. However, had they followed a good methodology, they wouldn't get answers that appear to contradict information theory.<br/>
<span id="dodging_around_historical_phonology">And proponents of mainstream linguistics say they strive to make their theories coherent with historical phonology, but to me it seems they are quite often inventing reasons why historical phonology doesn't apply. You want to support an etymology that doesn't contain sound changes that are expected to have occurred? Invent that it is about recent borrowing! You know, like Dubravka Ivšić thought the river name Karašica is related to the Latin fish name <i>carassius</i>. So, why didn't the 'a' change to 'o', that is, why isn't Karašica today called something like *<i>Koroša</i>? Well, Dubravka Ivšić invented the reason that the fish name <i>carassius</i> was recently borrowed into Croatian and that the river name <i>Karašica</i> dates only to the 17th century. You want to support an etymology that contains completely unexpected sound changes? Invent some unattested language that supposedly contained those sound changes! Like when Melich Janos proposed an etymology that Karašica comes from Turkic "<i>kara sub</i>" (black water). Why did 'b' disappear and why did 's' turn into 'š'? Melich Janos invented that some unattested Turkic language with those sound changes was spoken in eastern Croatia. Doing those things is not being coherent with historical phonology, that is dodging around historical phonology. Historical phonology, if anything, suggests that the river name Karašica comes from something like *<i>Kurrurrissia</i>.</span><br/><br/>
UPDATE on 13/05/2024: I've made another video about Croatian toponyms, about how they prove that Illyrian was a centum language. You can see it <a href="https://youtu.be/4QQ2iJZnyUk">on YouTube</a> (<a href="ilirski.mp4">MP4</a>).<br/><br/>
UPDATE on 15/05/2024: I've opened a discussion about whether Albanian is descended from Illyrian on <a href="https://www.textkit.com/greek-latin-forum/viewtopic.php?p=228883#p228883">TextKit</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/1crr0jj/eratne_lingua_illyrica_centum_aut_satem_lingua/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">r/latin</a>:
<div class="quotation" lang="la"><b>Eratne lingua Illyrica "centum" aut "satem" lingua? Suntne Albani nativi in Balkane?</b>
<br/><br/>
Quid homines in hac agora censent, eratne lingua Illyrica "centum" aut "satem" lingua? Linguae Indo-Europeae omnes in duas uniones divisae sunt: "centum" et "satem". In "centum" linguis, Indo-Europeanum phonemum 'kj' in 'k' vertitur. Lingua Latina est "centum" lingua, etiam sunt lingua Graeca et lingua Anglica. In lingua Anglica vere 'kj' in 'h' vertitur, sed, quodam tempore, ante Grimmi legem, 'kj' in 'k' vertebatur in lingua Anglica, et propterea lingua Anglica est "centum" lingua. In "satem" linguis, 'kj' in 's' vertitur. Exempla "satem" linguarum sunt lingua Croatica, lingua Albanica et lingua Sanskrit. James Patrick Mallory scripsit in Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture se censere id, num Illyrica erat "centum" aut "satem", ex datis quae habemus, sciri non posse. Plurimi linguistae in Croatia, et alibi in Balkane, censent linguam Illyricam fuisse "satem" linguam et etiam progenitorem esse linguae Albanicae. Sed ego censeo linguam Illyricam "centum" linguam fuisse. Die ante heri, ego publicavi YouTube filamentum in lingua Croatica de eo.
<br/>
<a href="https://youtu.be/4QQ2iJZnyUk">https://youtu.be/4QQ2iJZnyUk</a>
<br/>
In eo filamento, do quinque argumenta pro idea quia lingua Illyrica erat "centum" lingua. Ea argumenta sunt:
<ol>
<li>'K'-'r' regularitas in nominibus fluminum in Croatia. In multis nominibus fluminum in Croatia, primus consonans est 'k' et secundus consonans est 'r': Krka, Korana, Krapina, Krbavica, Kravar&scaron;&ccaron;ica, et duo flumina cum nomine Kara&scaron;ica. Plurimi linguistae censent eam regularitatem coincidentalem esse, sed ego censeo quia theoria informationis (Paradoxa Dierum Natalium et Entropia Collisionum) docet nobis quia probabilitas ut ea regularitas apparet coincidentaliter est inter 1/300 et 1/17. Calculationem habetis in meo textu "Etimologija Kara&scaron;ica", quod publicavi in almanaco Valpovački Godišnjak anno Domini 2022-o. Ego censeo quia nomen "Kara&scaron;ica" venit ex Illyrico nomine Kurr-urr-issia, et quia "kurr" significabat "fluere" (probabiliter ex Indo-Europea *kjers, quod significabat "currere"), "urr" significabat "aqua" (ex Indo-Europea *weh1r), et "-issia" erat suffixum in lingua Illyrica, quod etiam est in antiquo nomine pro &#x0110;akovo, "Certissia". Per me, nomen "Kurrurrissia" ivit ex Illyrico in Prae-Sclavicum *K&#x044a;r&#x044a;r&#x044c;s&#x044c;ja, quod dedit "Karrasj-"&gt;"Kara&scaron;-ica" (-ica est Croaticum suffixum) in hodierna lingua Croatica. Ego etiam censeo Krapina venisse ex Illyrico nomine Kar-p-ona, "kar" ex *kjers, "p" ex *h2ep (aqua), et "ona" erat suffixum in multis Illyricis nominibus locorum, inter alia, "Salona" et "Albona". Per me, nomen "Karpona" ivit ex Illyrico in Prae-Sclavicum *Korpyna, quod dedit "Krapina" in hodierna lingua Croatica. Et cetera...
</li><li>Si lingua Illyrica erat "centum" lingua, "Curicum", antiquum nomen pro Krk, potest legi ut "caurus, ventus borealis", ex Indo-Euroepea *(s)kjeh1weros (unde Latinum verbum "caurus" venit), et Krk est borealissima insula in mare nostro.
</li><li>Si lingua Illyrica erat "centum" lingua, "Incerum", antiquum nomen pro Po&zcaron;ega, potest legi ut "cor vallis", ex Indo-Europeais radicibus *h1eyn (vallis) et *kjer(d) (cor).
</li><li>Si lingua Illyrica erat "centum" lingua, "Cibelae", antiquum nomen pro Vinkovci, potest legi ut "firma casa" vel "castrum", ex Indo-Europeis radicibus *kjey (casa) et *bel (firmus).
</li><li>Multae inscriptiones in lingua Illyrica incipiunt cum "klauhi zis", et id probabiliter significabat "Audiat Deus...". "Klauhi" ergo probabiliter venit ex *kjlew (audire), ergo, *kj vertitur in *k in lingua Illyrica.
</li></ol>
Audiunturne ea argumenta vobis compellentia?

UPDATE on 28/05/2024: I've written another rhetoric for defending my alternative interpretation of the Croatian toponyms:
<div class="quotation" lang="hr">
	Gle, kada uočiš kontradikciju između dva polja znanosti (recimo, između teorije informacija i onomastike), prvo, naravno, trebaš pretpostaviti da si nešto krivo razumio. Trebaš se posavjetovati sa stručnjakom (a ne pretpostaviti da možeš samostalno zaključivati o nečemu što si učio jedan semestar, kao ja teoriju informacija). Ali ako kontradikcija ne bude razriješena (stručnjaci za teoriju informacija tvrde da su moji izračuni točni), trebaš pretpostaviti da je tvrđa znanost u pravu (u ovom slučaju, naravno, teorija informacija), a da je mekana znanost u krivu. Jer obično to tako bude.<br/>
	Dobro, postoje iznimke, kao što je Paradoks mladog Sunca. Početkom 20. stoljeća, recimo, geologija (koja je relativno mekana znanost) tvrdila je da je Zemlja stara barem milijunima godina, a fizika (koja je tvrda znanost) je tvrdila da Sunce ne može biti starije od sto tisuća godina. Kasnije se, naravno, ispostavilo da je tadašnja fizika potpuno krivo shvatila kako Sunce funkcionira, jer se Sunce bazira na nuklearnim reakcijama o kojima tadašnja fizika nije znala ništa. Ipak, mislim da se ovdje ne događa ništa slično kao Paradoks mladog Sunca. Onomastika nije ni približno tvrda kao geologija (a teorija informacija je, ako išta, tvrđa od fizike), a i argumenti koje onomastika daje doimaju se nevjerojatno slabima.<br/>
Osnovni argument Melich Janosevog teksta o tome da Karašica dolazi od turkijskog *kara-sub ide ovako: "<i>U ranom srednjem vijeku, zapisana imena za baranjsku Karašicu bila su Mogyoros, Feketeviz i Karassou. S obzirom na to da ime Feketeviz znači crna voda, ime Karassou vjerojatno znači isto. Ime Karassou zvuči donekle slično kao praturkijski *kara-sub, dakle ono mora dolaziti od tamo. Evo glasovnih promjena ad-hoc za koje pretpostavljam da su se dogodile u tom turkijskom jeziku odakle dolazi ime Karassou.</i>". Meni nije jasno kako netko taj argument može smatrati uvjerljivim.
</div>
<br/>
UPDATE on 31/10/2024: Anyway, I've decided to open <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/1gfzbvt/what_do_the_advocates_of_mainstream_onomastics/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">a Reddit thread</a> about what the advocates of mainstream onomastics mean when they say "<i>The etymologies from the languages we know a lot about (Croatian, Latin, Celtic...) are more probable than the etymologies from languages we know little about (Illyrian...).</i>". What is the mathematical basis for that principle? I don't see it. What I do see is that following that principle gives results which are incompatible with information theory. Following that principle gave the result that the k-r pattern in the Croatian river names is coincidental, but basic information theory strongly suggests that the p-value of that pattern is somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17. But maybe somebody can explain that principle mathematically.<br/><br/>
UPDATE on 03/11/2024: A possible unexpected confirmation of my hypothesis that *karr~kurr was the Illyrian word for "to flow": <a href="https://www.forum.hr/showpost.php?p=105891715&postcount=2">A <code>forum.hr</code> user called <i>petielement</i> claims that &quot;<i>kurit</i>&quot; means &quot;<i>to flow</i>&quot; in some Dalmatian dialects</a>.<br/><br/>
UPDATE on 13/05/2025: An objection I often receive on Internet forums when I am arguing for my alternative interpretation of the Croatian toponyms is that the burden of proof is on me. I think I've figured out a way to respond to that claim:
		    <div class="quotation" lang="hr">Gle, ti si onaj koji tvrdi da je ponašanje jezika suprotno od onog što predviđa teorija informacija dominantno. I pod "predviđa" ne mislim da teorija informacija daje nekakav <i lang="en">vague prediction</i>, mislim da daje točne brojeve (recimo, da je p-vrijednost tog k-r uzorka u nazivima rijeka u Hrvatskoj negdje između 1/300 i 1/17). Breme dokaza definitivno je na tebi. I to još teže breme dokaza nego što je breme dokaza na zastupnicima marksizma ili Austrijske škole ekonomije kad tvrde da je ljudsko ekonomsko ponašanje suprotno onom što ga predviđa teorija igara dominantno. To je zato što teorija igara, koliko ja znam, ne radi kvantitativna predviđanja u vezi s tim stvarima (radi samo kvalitativna predviđanja), dok teorija informacija baš radi kvantitativna predviđanja što se tiče naziva mjesta. U izuzetno si lošoj poziciji što se tiče bremena dokaza.</div>
