            <br/>Toponyms are often affected by the linguistic phenomenon called tautology.
            A toponym is often composed of more words in different languages meaning exactly the same.
            A famous example of that is <i>Torpenhow Hill</i>.<br>

                <b>SUMMARY</b>: It will be argued that it is impossible that the Illyrian language died out in ancient times, as the mainstream historical linguistics claims, but that it is nearly certain that it, despite never being attested, died relatively recently and that many, if not most of the, Croatian toponyms come from it. The main argument for that is that, if the toponyms came from the Croatian language, most of them would make sense to those who speak Croatian, yet the vast majority of them don't. Alternative etymologies are proposed for around 100 toponyms in or on the borders of Croatia. Some basic vocabulary of Illyrian is reconstructed, the most certain words are: *issa~iasa, meaning "source of a health-giving water", presumably coming from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/i̯es.htm">root</a> meaning "boiling" or "spring", *karr~kurr, meaning "to flow", presumably from a Pre-Indo-European substrate language and cognate to the Late Latin fish names "carpa" and "carassius", *kull~kl meaning "mountain", presumably from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/kel-1_kelə.htm">root</a> meaning "high", *mar~mur, meaning "marsh", almost certainly from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/mori_mōri.htm">root</a> meaning "marsh" or "sea", *api, meaning "water", from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/ā̆p-2.htm">root</a> meaning "body of water", the word *pis~pik meaning "coniferous forest", almost certainly <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/pei̯_ə_-_pī̆.htm">related</a> to the Latin word "pix" (resin), and the word *melit~malit, meaning "sea island", probably of Pre-Indo-European origin. The evidence is consistent enough that some grammatical features of Illyrian can also be inferred, such as the /a/~/u/ ablaut. My conclusion is that Illyrian was a centum Indo-European language with some specific sound changes, such as *b<sup>h</sup> turning to /p/ in some conditions (perhaps only before 'a') and into /β/ (voiced bilabial fricative) in others, *k<sup>j</sup> turning to /j/ (the semi-vowel) in front of a nasal, *g<sup>j</sup> turning into /x/ (velar fricative) in at least some conditions, *k<sup>w</sup> turning into /k/, single consonants being geminated after a short vowel (presumably because all the syllables had to be of equal length), the diphthongs *ew and *ey monophthongized into long /i/, syllabic consonants turning into /i+C/ and, most importantly, the initial laryngeals being preserved as /e/ (presumably because of a word-initial accent). The reconstructed grammar is then exemplified by translating the Lord's Prayer into Illyrian.

                Croatian is a Slavic language. However,
                I think there aren't actually that many Slavic toponyms in Croatia.
                If there were, they would make sense to those who speak Croatian, and
                the vast majority of them don't. Many of the toponyms commonly accepted
                to be Croatian in origin don't even sound (phonotactically) Croatian,
                such as <a class="map">Delnice</a> (the cluster <i>-eln-</i>, in native Croatian words,
                the 'l' in <i>-iln-</i> and <i>-eln-</i> gets vocalized into 'o',
                such as in "čeoni", derived from "čelo", or "dionica", derived from
                the verb "dijel-i-ti"). So, I argue that attempts to explain
                the Croatian toponyms without an obvious etymology with Slavic roots
                is, in fact, a very flawed method, and I attempt to reconstruct a
                language of the ancient Croatian toponyms (the Illyrian language) and
                explain the toponyms using it.<br/>
                <a name="introduction"></a>To give you an example, <i>Issa</i>, the
                ancient name for the island of <a class="map">Vis</a>, isn't explicable by Latin or
                Greek, and is widely stated to have an unknown, perhaps
                Pre-Indo-European etymology. But here is a clue: there were some
                quite strong springs there in ancient times, that the Roman baths were
                getting water from. And wherever there were large Roman baths in
                Croatia, the same or similar element repeats. The ancient name for
                <a class="map">Daruvar</a> was <i>Balissa</i> and the ancient name for
                <a class="map">Varaždinske Toplice</a> was <i>Iasa</i>. There
                we have it: *issa~iasa meant &quot;spas&quot; (health-giving springs). And I believe I can
                trace that name back to Proto-Indo-European: it probably comes from
                *yos (spring, derived from *yes, "to boil") and the collective noun
                ending *eh<sub>2</sub> (probably pronounced &quot;ah&quot;). The <i>Bal-</i> in <i>Balissa</i>
                can be explained as being related to the Latin word <i>bullire</i> (to boil), so that
                <i>Balissa</i> means "boiling health-giving springs". Using that knowledge,
                we can explain some modern Croatian toponyms without an obvious Croatian
                etymology, like Jozinci (assuming an ancient name such as *Iasona,
                meaning "on the health-giving spring", in the sense "on the source of salt water",
                since salt was believed to have health-giving properties by people of ancient Slavonia).
                Namely, Jozinci is a small village near <a class="map">Donji Miholjac</a>. It's known that, in ancient times,
                there was a stream of brackish water flowing through Donji Miholjac, but it's
                not certain where its source was. It might have very well been in Jozinci
                (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('jozinci')">show/hide details</a>).<br/>
                <span id="jozinci" style="display:none">
                Of course, things are a lot more complicated than the above paragraph might lead you to believe.
                Here is what Dubravka Ivšić, perhaps the most prominent Croatian etymologist
                (supporting the mainstream interpretations of the Croatian toponyms),
                said about it when I asked her via e-mail:
                <span class="quotation" lang="hr">
                    Naselje "Issa" osnovali su Grci, a ne Iliri. Rimske terme su bile jednostavno
                    kupališta, nisu nužno bile ljekovite. Puno je vjerojatnije da je "-issa"
                    u toponimima poput "Balissa" i "Certissa" sufiks nego da su to složenice
                    (uspoređuju se s keltskim toponimima u kojima je "-issa" sufiks). Drugim
                    riječima, po svemu sudeći, toponim "Issa" morfološki nije usporediv s
                    "-issa" u Balissa, a i čini se da ti toponimi pripadaju različitim
                    slojevima, tj. različitim jezicima (treba voditi računa i o
                    geografskoj udaljenosti). "Iasa" u "Aquae Iasae" se i inače izvodi od
                    indoeuropskog *yes 'vreti', i moglo bi pripadati istom jeziku kao "Balissa", ali
                    ponovno nije morfološki usporedivo. Ako i pretpostavimo da "Issa" i "Iasa"
                    pripadaju istom jeziku (što je malo vjerojatno), trebalo bi objasniti
                    razliku u obliku (ako ciljate na indoeuropski ablaut, treba objasniti kakav je
                    to ablaut i zašto se razlikuju stupnjevi).

                If you are not able to understand it, not even using <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a>, which
                usually does a good job translating Croatian to English (though not the other way around),
                perhaps you shouldn't proceed reading.<br/>
                Anyway, I find the arguments rather weak, primarily because the mainstream linguistics considers the name
                "Issa" to be related to the toponym <a class="map" data-look="Antissa,+Greece">Antissa</a> on the Greek island of Lesbos, and Vis and Lesbos are
                even further away from each other than Vis and Daruvar are. As for the Celtic suffix "-issa", it probably
                doesn't go back to Proto-Indo-European for it to be relevant here, since Proto-Indo-European phonotactics generally avoided geminates
                (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('geminati')">show/hide details</a>).
                There does indeed appear to be a suffix "-issia" in Illyrian. As for the differences in the grades of ablaut,
                that's not so surprising if you take into account that there were two words for spring in Proto-Slavic that were different only
                by a grade of ablaut, *virŭ and *vorŭ. Again, I can't promise you (and probably nobody can) to know all the relevant technical details.<br/>
                <span id="geminati" style="display:none">
                    Here is how Dubravka Ivšić responded to the question "Why would you assume that the suffix -issa, found in Celtic languages, also existed in Illyrian, when it obviously couldn't have existed in Proto-Indo-European (whose phonotactics didn't allow geminate consonants)?":
                    <span class="quotation" lang="hr">
                        Ako je sufiks -issa postojao u ilirskom, onda je to bio ilirski sufiks, kao što je svaki sufiks kojim se tvore hrvatske riječi hrvatski sufiks.<br/>
                        Međutim, postavlja se pitanje što je to ilirski. Po onome što se danas zna, čini se da se naziv "ilirski" koristi za domorodačke indoeuropske jezike na našem tlu (i šire) koji su se govorili prije latinskog i grčkog (neko vrijeme su supostojali), i čije su jedine potvrde toponimi i antroponimi zapisani latinskim i grčkim slovima. Vjerojatno je bilo više "ilirskih" jezika (npr. liburnski, delmatski, histarski) i nije jasno koliko su bili srodni. U novije doba govori se i o jednom takvom "panonskom" jeziku, kojem bi pripadali i (neki) predslavenski toponimi u sjevernoj Hrvatskoj. U sjevernoj Hrvatskoj još postoji i teoretska mogućnost keltskih toponima (iako je samo Carrodunum sigurno keltski), pa ako je Certissa keltskog podrijetla, onda je u njemu sufiks -issa keltski. Uglavnom, to je metodološko pitanje - kako ćemo što definirati, a o svemu skupa ima premalo podataka da bismo išta sigurno tvrdili.<br/>
                        To što u praindoeuropskom nisu postojale geminate ne znači da se one nisu mogle razviti u pojedinim jezicima.

                    I'll leave you there to decide for youself. I took that as an admission that the mainstream interpretation of the names of places in Croatia goes against not only combinatorial evidence, but also against accepted facts (though not strictly, it's possible, although it's unlikely, that the identical suffix developed in both Illyran and Celtic) from comparative linguistics. While linguistics is not a science in the same way physics is, that doesn't mean such things don't matter.<br/>

                By far the most common counter-argument I get is that, if a toponym doesn't come from Croatian, perhaps it comes from some other attested language, the most commonly proposed being Latin. Most of the such proposed etymologies can be easily refuted, <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('latin')">click here</a> to see (or hide) how.<br/>

                    <img src="rules.png" style="width:100%;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px" alt="The sound-change laws for the Latin toponyms in Croatia."/>
                    Many, if not most of the, supposed Latin etymologies of the toponyms of modern-day Croatia can be refuted simply by pointing to the basic facts of the historical phonology. They should be the way of establishing the basic rigour in studying the toponyms. Nevertheless, they are only rarely mentioned in the papers about toponyms. Here are the ones that I consider to be most important. Classical Latin long /i/, in Vulgar Latin, turned into a sound similar or identical to the Old Croatian front yer, that later, according to the Havlik's Law (and, in the Chakavian dialect of Croatian, the law that the yers in the first syllable are always vocalized), turned into 'a' (or 'e' in the Kaikavian dialect) or simply disappeared. A beautiful example of that is the toponym <a class="map">Cavtat</a> (folk etymologies often connect it to the Croatian word <i>cvat</i>, meaning <i>flower</i>), derived from Latin <i>Cīvitāte (Vetere)</i> (in the old city). Similarly, the ancient name for <a class="map">Caska</a> was <i>Cīssa</i> (probably an Illyrian word related to the Greek name for the ivy plant, κισσος). Classical Latin short /i/, in Vulgar Latin, turned into a sound similar or identical to Old Croatian yat, which, in standard Croatian, turned into the diphthong /ie/ (spelled 'je' or 'ije'). A beautiful example of that is the toponym <a class="map">Srijem</a>, from the Latin name <i>Sĭrmĭum</i> (the name is obviously Illyrian in origin, from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/ser-1.htm">root</a> meaning "flow", as there are many rivers there, the /r/ and the yat switched places regularly due to the metathesis of the liquids, operating in Croatian until the 11th century). It's interesting to note that, in antiquity, there were three places named <i>Sirmium</i>, one was the modern-day Srijem, the other one was the modern-day Šibenik (whose ancient name is preserved in the name of the peninsula <a class="map">Srima</a>), and the third one is <a class="map" data-look="Sirmione">Sirmione</a>. The apparent counter-examples (<a class="map">Silba</a>&lt;sĭlva, <a class="map">Piškera</a>&lt;pĭscis...) are confined to the dialects in which the Old Croatian yat regularly turned to /i/. The same is true for the Classical Latin short 'e', which is illustrated by the Latin name for <a class="map">Mljet</a>, <i>Melita</i> (which is probably a Pre-Indo-European word for sea island, compare the toponyms <a class="map">Molat</a> and <a class="map" data-look="Malta">Malta</a>). Classical Latin long /u/ turned into a sound similar or identical to the Old Croatian back yer, which behaved just like the front yer, except that it didn't participate in the Second Slavic Palatalization (still productive in modern Croatian). For example, the Latin name for the island of <a class="map">Krk</a> was <i>Cūricum</i> (perhaps from an Illyrian word meaning "north", <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/k̂ēu̯ero-_k̂ōu̯ero-_auch_sk̂ūro.htm">related</a> to Lithuanian "šiaure" and Latin "caurus"). Vulgar Latin short 'u' turned into 'o'. For instance, the Latin name for <a class="map">Rovinj</a> was <i>Ruinium</i>. The only counter-example I know is the name <a class="map">Trogir</a>, derived from the Latin name <i>Tragurium</i>, but that's actually a name (apparently) derived from a Greek word (τραγος, goat), and the 'u' may have been pronounced /y/. Vulgar Latin long /o/ usually gets borrowed as /u/ in Old Croatian, because, quite simply, Old Croatian didn't have long /o/. An example of that is the toponym <a class="map">Pula</a> (from the Latin name <i>Pōla</i>, probably from an Illyrian word <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/pel-1_pelə-_plē.htm">related</a> to the Greek word πολις). Apparent counter-examples (<a class="map">Labin</a>&lt;Albona, <a class="map">Solin</a>&lt;Salona...) are explicable as Croats changing the suffix to fit their declension patterns. And, of course, the most obvious rule, yet apparently sometimes ignored, the Classical Latin long and short 'a' came to be pronounced as a sound that was almost always borrowed as 'o' in Old Croatian (<a class="map">Trogir</a>&lt;Tragurion, <a class="map">Solin</a>&lt;Salona, <a class="map">Mosor</a>&lt;Massarum...). Almost all the apparent counter-examples (<a class="map">Labin</a>&lt;Albona, <a class="map">Raša</a>&lt;Arsia, <a class="map">Skradin</a>&lt;Scardona...) are explicable as a result of the metathesis of liquids, which regularly turned *orC and *olC into /raC/ and /laC/. Other apparent counter-examples can be explained as borrowing directly from Illyrian (<a class="map">Drava</a>, <a class="map">Sava</a>...) or, coincidentally, unknown phonotactical details of Old Croatian (the Latin names for Drava and Sava were <i>Draus</i> and <i>Saus</i>, but Proto-Slavic didn't allow wovel sequences within a morpheme). Of course, sometimes (usually quite obvious) folk-etymologies change the accents (and therefore, by affecting the later sound-changes, the vowels), such as in the case of the island name <a class="map">Lastovo</a> (the ancient name was <i>Ladesta</i>, perhaps an Illyrian word derived from the Indo-European <a href="https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/lat.htm">root</a> meaning "water", but the modern name looks as if it was from the Croatian word for the swallow bird, "lasta"), however those things happen rather rarely. Another rule, maybe slightly less obvious, but still hard to miss if you study Croatian toponyms, the Classical Latin /v/ turned into /β/ in Vulgar Latin, which was regularly borrowed as /b/ in Old Croatian (<a class="map">Silba</a>&lt;silva, <a class="map">Bribir</a>&lt;Varvaria...). Therefore, the toponyms starting with a 'v' can't be Latin in origin. Those rules are especially accurate if you look at the names in the local dialects. For instance, the name for <a class="map">Brač</a> (ancient name <i>Brattia</i>) in the local dialect is <i>Broc</i>, the name for <a class="map">Hvar</a> (ancient name <i>Pharos</i>) in the local dialect is <i>For</i>, and the name for <a class="map">Šolta</a> (ancient name <i>Solenta</i>) in the local dialect is <i>Sulet</i> (probably because the exonyms weren't actually borrowed from Vulgar Latin).<br/>Yet, those things are often ignored by the etymologists. For instance, the mainstream etymology considers the toponym <a class="map">Viljevo</a> to be derived from the Latin word <i>vīlla</i>. The simple truth is, <i>vīlla</i>, borrowed into Old Croatian, would give something like <i>*Bal</i> (genitive singular <i>*Bla</i>) in Modern Croatian (in my opinion, the name <i>Viljevo</i> is indeed related to the homonymous dialectal Croatian word meaning <i>oak forest</i>, which is perhaps derived from a phrase meaning "in the Saint Elias'es forest"). The mainstream etymology considers the toponym <a class="map">Batina</a> to be derived from Latin <i>*Batinus</i> (dedicated to Bato the Illyrian). Well, first of all, the grammatical way for naming a city after a person named <i>Bato</i> would be <i>*Batinianus</i>. Second, <i>*Batinus</i>, borrowed into Old Croatian, would give <i>*Boten</i> or <i>*Botan</i> in modern Croatian. So much about it. Besides, there is an identical name of place near <a class="map">Kutina</a>, hundreds of miles away. Some people (though it's not really mainstream linguistics) say that the name of the river <a class="map">Una</a> derives from the Latin word <i>ūna</i> (one) supposedly in the sense "the most beautiful". Well, first, if you were to name a river as "the most beautiful", you would use the Latin word <i>primum (flumen)</i>, and certainly not <i>una</i>. Second, <i>ūna</i>, borrowed into Old Croatian, would give <i>*Van</i> in modern Croatian (the prothetic 'v' would have to be added in front of the back yer). I hope you see where I am coming from. The phonology of Vulgar Latin is known, and it doesn't explain most of the modern Croatian toponyms. The phonology of Illyrian is not known right now, but it can hopefully be reconstructed from the toponyms.<br/>
                    And the same goes for some other languages that are suggested to be the source of modern-day Croatian toponyms. Mainstream linguistics connects the ancient name for <a class="map">Split</a>, <i>Spalatum</i>, with the Greek word for <i>spiny broom</i> (a flower), <i>ασπαλαθος</i>. Yet, the modern name <i>Split</i> points to it being borrowed as <i>*Speltos</i>, with an alternation between 'a' in <i>Spalatum</i> and 'e' in <i>*Speltos</i>. This alternation would have been irregular in Ancient Greek, but it might have very well been regular in Illyrian (since, for instance, the name <a class="map">Dalmatia</a> was also attested in antiquity as "Delmatia", and the ancient name for the island of Brač, "Brattia", was also attested as "Brettia", and those names are without a doubt Illyrian). In addition to that, a placename being apparently derived from a plant name or an animal name without there being a suffix (as in the case of <i>Spalatum</i> being apparently derived from <i>aspalathos</i>) is a typical sign of a folk-etymology.<br/>
					The strong bias to assign the origins of names of places in Croatia to Latin and Greek is also seen in what's written about the name <a class="map">Koška</a>, namely, that it comes from Latin <i>castellum</i> (castle). The phonetic difficulties with connecting the two are rather obvious, and, not only that, there is an identical toponym on the island of <a class="map" data-look="Koška,+Šolta">Šolta</a>, and, in the local dialect, <i>koška</i> means <i>rock whose shape reminds of a bird</i>, from Proto-Slavic *kosŭ (<i>blackbird</i>, probably itself from Greek <i>κοψιχος</i>) and the adjective ending <i>-ka</i>. Doesn't it make by orders of magnitude more sense to suggest those two toponyms are related, and that <i>koška</i> used to mean the same thing in the Slavonian dialect of Croatian?<br/>

                Here is a list of
                the etymologies of the Croatian toponyms I've supported on the
                &quot;Croatian Toponyms&quot; thread linked on the left:<br/>
                Aenona
                (<a class="map">Nin</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>ek<sup>j</sup>-mon (where a lot of stones
                are)<br/>
                Albona (<a class="map">Labin</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>elb<sup>h</sup>
                (white). It's unknown what the precise pronunciation of 'b' was, some sources spell it as 'v'. It might have been /β/.<br/>
                Alma (<a class="map">Fruška Gora</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>elm
                (fertile)<br/>
                Almissia (<a class="map">Omiš</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>elm-yess (on a
                fertile ground)<br/>
                Andautonia (<a class="map">Zagreb</a>) &lt; *h<sub>2</sub>en-d<sup>h</sup>eh<sub>2</sub>-ont-om
                (near that which flows). The name <i>Zagreb</i> itself probably means "the God's hill", from the Illyrian word <i>Dzis</i> (God), mentioned on the Messapian inscriptions, and a word related to Proto-Slavic *gora and Sanskrit <i>giri</i>. So, the Illyrian name might have been *Dzigurevos, borrowed into Old Croatian via Vulgar Latin.<br/>
                <a class="map">Apševci</a> &lt; from an Illyrian name (borrowed directly from Illyrian, not via Vulgar Latin) such as *Apissios, meaning "river island", derived from the Indo-European root *h<sub>2</sub>ep (water), for the semantics compare the Croatian toponym <a class="map">Otok</a> near <a class="map">Vinkovci</a>. Similar names occur repeatedly in microtoponymy, for instance, near <a class="map">Donji Miholjac</a> there is a field called Apšaldol.<br/>
                Arsia (<a class="map">Raša river</a>) &lt; *h<sub>3</sub>rews
                (to flow fast)<br/>
                Asinium (<a class="map">Sinj</a>) &lt; related to Proto-Slavic *asenŭ (ash tree). Or, perhaps even more likely, related to the Hittite word <i>haš</i> (stone), since the same element repeats in the names of other stony places. For instance, the ancient name for <a class="map">Osor</a> was <i>Assarum</i>.<br/>
                Balissa (<a class="map">Daruvar</a>) &lt; *boll-yos-eh<sub>2</sub>
                (where a lot of health-giving boiling springs are)<br/>
                <a class="map">Baranja</a> &lt;
                some sort of derivation from *mory (marsh), compare also Greek
                βορβορος and the ancient (almost certainly Illyrian) name for the river <a class="map" data-look="Bojana+river,+Montenegro" name="Bojana">Bojana</a>, "Barbanna" (attested by Titus Livius in Historia Romana in the 44th book and the 31st chapter). The Illyrian name might have been *Barrania, with the first 'a' stressed and long, compare the ancient name for <a class="map">Dinara</a>, "Dindaria" (while the modern name looks like as if it was from *Dinnaria), for the consonant cluster, in this case -rb- to -rr-, simplification.<br/>
                <a class="map" data-look="Bosut,+Hrvatska">Biđ</a> (the river) &lt; From an Illyrian name such as *Vōdios, from Proto-Indo-European *wed (wet), borrowed into Old Croatian from Vulgar Latin (therefore, 'v' regularly being borrowed as *b, long 'o' as *y, turning into 'i' in Modern Croatian, and 'di' regularly yotated into 'đ').<br/>
                Basante, Basuntius (<a class="map">Bosut</a>) &lt; *bel-sewh<sub>1</sub>-nt (strong
                waterer), see "Sutla" and "Sunja" for the sound changes. Modern name obviously comes from the name Basante (attested on Tabula Peutingeriana), rather than Basuntius (attested by Pliny the Elder in the 3rd book in the 28th chapter of Naturalis Historia), it's hard to tell what was the relationship between those two names in antiquity. I'd argue that Basuntius is more original, and that Basante is some form of folk etymology.<br/>
                Brettia (<a class="map">Brač</a>) &lt; To give some context, Stephanus of Byzantium wrote, in <i>De Urbibus</i>, that "Brettia", the ancient name for the island of Brač, means <i>deer's</i> (<i>Ελαφουσσα</i>) in Illyrian. That makes some sense considering that Strabo also wrote, in the 7th book in the 6th chapter of Geography, that "Brentesium", the ancient name for <a class="map" data-look="Brindisi,+Italy">Brindisi</a>, meant <i>deer's</i> in Messapian (probably a dialect of Illyrian), because its port resembles head of a deer. Also, <i>briedis</i> is the modern Latvian word for deer, so there is a plausible etymology of that Illyrian word. However, Stephanus of Byzantium also wrote that there is a stream (<i>ποταμος</i>) on the island of Brač that's also named "Brettia". It's hard to tell how plausible that is (I am not too familiar with geology), as there are no streams today on the island of Brač. Assuming that's true, that would probably mean that "Brettia" meaning "deer's" is folk etymology, since places are usually named after bodies of water rather than the other way around, and that the name "Brettia" is, in fact, related to names such as <a href="#Bojana"><i>Barbanna</i></a>. Another argument for that is that there is a stream in northern Croatia called <a class="map">Jelenska</a>, it flows into the <a class="map">Lonja River</a>, and the name <i>Jelenska</i> appears to come from the Croatian word for deer, <i>jelen</i>. It makes sense to suppose that's a similar folk-etymology, that Croatians translated an Illyrian name such as <i>Brettia</i> thinking it comes from the Illyrian word for deer, when it fact it's related to the Greek word <i>βορβορος</i>.<br/>
				Celenae (<a class="map">Orolik</a>) &lt; This name is attested only in the Burdigal (Jerusalem) Itinerary, as a horse market on a steep hill near Cibalae (<a class="map">Vinkovci</a>). Mainstream history places it in Orolik, and that seems like a reasonable assumption. Regarding etymology, my guess is that it is a celestially-themed name, related to Latin <i>caelum</i>, that it means something like <i>road to sky</i>. Such names are relatively common around the world, compare the names such as <a class="map" data-look="Hillah">Babylon</a> (Akkadian for <i>Gate to God</i>), the Chinese place names such as <a class="map" data-look="Tiananmen,+Beijing">Tiananmen</a> (天安門, <i>Gate of Heavenly Peace</i>), <a class="map" data-look="Tianmenshan,+China">Tianmenshan</a> (天門山, <i>Mountain of Heavenly Gate</i>), and the name <a class="map" data-look="Cheonan,+South+Korea">Cheonansi</a> coming from 天安市, Chinese for <i>City of Heavenly Peace</i>.<br/>
                Cersia (<a class="map">Cres</a>) &lt; *(s)k<sup>w</sup>er
                (cliff)<br/>
                Certissia (<a class="map">Đakovo</a>) &lt; *(s)ker-yess (on a sharp,
                infertile ground)<br/>
                Cibalae (<a class="map">Vinkovci</a>) &lt; *k<sup>j</sup>ey-bel
                (strong house)<br/>
                Colapis (<a class="map">Kupa</a>) &lt; *k<sup>w</sup>ol-h<sub>2</sub>ep
                ("wondering water", river with many meanders)<br/>
                <a class="map">Dalj</a> &lt; *d<sup>h</sup>el
                (milkmen, the Illyran name might have been *Dillioi)<br/>
                Daljok (<a class="map">Duboševica</a>) &lt; *d<sup>h</sup>el (milkmen)<br/>
                Daurum (<a class="map">Dubrovnik</a>) &lt; *deh<sub>2</sub>w (fire, in the sense "a place that was built where the forest has been burnt down"). The toponym *Daurum wasn't attested in antiquity per se, but the ancient name for <a class="map">Cavtat</a> (some 10 kilometers from Dubrovnik) was <i>Epi-Daurum</i> ("epi" almost certainly being the Greek prefix meaning "beside"). *Daur- borrowed into Old Croatian would regularly give *Dubr in modern Croatian, for the sound changes compare the ancient name for <a class="map">Bribir</a>, <i>Varuaria</i> (by the way, I think the modern name <a class="map">Varivode</a> could also derive from the ancient name of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Bribir,+%C5%A0ibensko-kninska+%C5%BEupanija/Varivode,+%C5%A0ibensko-kninska+%C5%BEupanija/@43.9432458,15.8373636,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x47602afe63a2cda7:0xaf8534a9d2122784!2m2!1d15.8437672!2d43.9220009!1m5!1m1!1s0x47602b8bcb2f94ab:0xe244f31f0765e846!2m2!1d15.8794758!2d43.9548803">near-by</a> place <i>Varuaria</i>, attested by Pliny the Elder in Naturalis Historia in book 3 chapter 25, as a later borrowing from Illyran into Croatian). A commonly cited etymology is that "Dubrovnik" comes from the Croatian word "dubrava" (oak forest). Well, first of all, it's not clear why the 'a' would turn to 'o'. It's also not clear why the ktetic would be irregular, people from Dubrovnik are called "Dubrovčani", rather than the expected "Dubrovničani".<br/>
                <a class="map">Dilj</a> (the mountain) &lt; *delh<sub>1</sub>
                (wide, the Illyrian name might have been *Dilios, if borrowed directly from Illyrian, or *Delios, if borrowed through Latin)<br/>
                Dindaria (<a class="map">Dinara</a> mountain) &lt; *dent (tooth), the change -nd- to -nn- probably occured in Illyrian after the name <i>Dindaria</i> was attested by Pliny the Elder in Naturalis Historia in the 3rd book in the 26th chapter.<br/>
                <a class="map">Drava</a> (the river) &lt; *drew (to pour)<br/>
                Dunav (<a class="map">Danube</a> river) &lt; *danu
                (river, It's unknown what was the first vowel in Illyrian, because both nasalized 'a', nasalized 'o' and nasalized 'u' turn into 'u' in Croatian)<br/>
                Eira (perhaps the river <a class="map">Mura</a>, attested in Ravenna Cosmography) &lt; *h<sub>1</sub>er (to flow)<br/>
                <a class="map" data-look="Vinkovci,+Hrvatska">Ervenica</a> (a stream in Slavonia) &lt; *h<sub>3</sub>rews

                Esseg (<a class="map">Osijek</a>) &lt; *h<sub>1</sub>es-seg (healthy
                field)<br/>
                Histria (the <a class="map">Istria</a> peninsula) &lt; related to Proto-Slavic *ostrovŭ (island), maybe in the sense "people from the island".<br/>
                <a class="map" data-look="Hrvatska">Hrvat</a> (Croat) &lt; *ser-h<sub>2</sub>ek<sup>w</sup>-ot

                health-giving springs are", in reference to the spring which the Roman baths were getting their water from, see the <a href="#introduction">introduction</a>)<br/>
                <a class="map">Kalnik</a> &lt; *kelh<sub>3</sub> (high, the wovel in "Kal-" must have originally been short 'u', reguarly changing to back yer and then to 'a' in Croatian, and there must have been either short 'i' or short 'u' after l, disappearing due to the Havlik's law. So, the Illyrian form was either *Kullunnicos or *Kullinnicos. The toponym was borrowed from Illyrian into Old Croatian after the Third Slavic Palatalization, but possibly before the Second Slavic Palatalization.)<br/>
                <a class="map">Karašica</a> &lt; from a verb *karr~kurr
                meaning &quot;to flow&quot;, perhaps of Pre-Indo-European
                origin<br/>
                Kentina (<a class="map" data-look="Cetina,+Hrvatska">Sinjsko Polje</a>, a name used by Constantine VII in De Administrando Imperio) &lt; *k<sup>j</sup>em-t-h<sub>1</sub>eyn
                (the valley of horses)<br/>
                <a class="map">Klek Mountain</a> &lt; *kelh<sub>3</sub> (high, the change from *kelk to *klek would be regular in Croatian, because the methatesis of the liquids ended way after the first Slavic palatalization.)<br/>
                <a class="map">Korana</a> &lt; from a verb *karr~kurr meaning &quot;to

                <a class="map">Krapina</a> &lt;
                from a verb *karr~kurr meaning &quot;to flow&quot;, perhaps of
                Pre-Indo-European origin, -ap- is probably from the Indo-European root *h<sub>2</sub>ep (water)<br/>
                <a class="map">Krbava</a> (likely originally a hydronym) &lt;
                from a verb *karr~kurr meaning &quot;to flow&quot;, perhaps of
                Pre-Indo-European origin<br/>
                <a class="map">Krka</a> &lt; from a verb *karr~kurr meaning &quot;to

                <a class="map" data-look="Krndija+Mountain,+Hrvatska">Krndija</a> &lt;
                *(s)ker-nt (cutting, steep). The Illyrian name might have been *Curindea (compare the ancient name for <a class="map">Krk</a>, <i>Curicum</i>, for the sound changes from Old Croatian to Modern Croatian). The change from Proto-Indo-European *-ent- to Illyrian -ind- is hard to explain, but it's not isolated (if <i>Dindaria</i> comes from *dent).<br/>
                <a class="map">Lika</a> (likely originally a hydronym, attested in the ancient toponym "Epi-licum")
                &lt; *lewk (clear)<br/>
                Lissa &lt; This toponym was attested in ancient times by Pliny the Elder in Naturalis Historia in 3rd book in the 63rd chapter as "Contra Iader est Lissa.", <i>Iader</i> being the ancient name for <a class="map">Zadar</a>. The mainstream history generally considers that toponym to be a corruption of the ancient name for <a class="map">Pag</a>, <i>Cissa</i>. However, I think that, if Pliny wanted to refer to Pag, he could a lot more appropriately write "contra Aenonam" or, even better, "contra Vegium" (<i>Vegium</i> being the ancient name for <a class="map">Karlobag</a>), rather than "contra Iader". So, I think this toponym, in antiquity, referred to <a class="map">Ugljan</a>. And I think that, in the late stages of Illyrian, that was the generic word for island, whichever root it comes from. Namely, the modern Italian name for <a class="map">Vis</a> is <i>Lissa</i>, and the modern Italian name for <a class="map">Hvar</a> is <i>Lesina</i>. The modern island name <a class="map">Lošinj</a>, unattested in antiquity, could come from that same root.<br/>
                Mantouna (<a class="map">Motovun</a>) &lt; *men (mountain)<br/>
                Mariniana (<a class="map">Donji Miholjac</a>) &lt; *mory-h<sub>1</sub>eyn

                (a town on a marsh)<br/>
                <a class="map">Medvednica</a> (the mountain) &lt; from an Illyrian name such as *Menduenda, from the Indo-European root *men (to be high), perhaps exactly cognate to the Latin word <i>mons</i> (genitive singular <i>montis</i>), compare Dindaria for the change from <i>-nt-</i> to <i>-nd-</i>. It shares the same root as the ancient name for <a class="map">Knin</a>, <i>Pria<b>mon</b>a</i> (attested by Strabo in the 7th book in the 5th chapter of Geography, <i>Pria-mona</i> can be read as <i>in front of a mountain</i>, because it is in front of a mountain when lookng from the seaside) and <i><b>Man</b>touna</i>, the ancient name for <a class="map">Motovun</a>.<br/>

                &lt; *ner (to dive) It's interesting to note that the names of many rivers that aren't even partly underground come from a word meaning "to dive". For instance, the name of the river <a class="map" data-look="Jordan+river,+Israel">Jordan</a> most likely comes from a Phoenician word sharing the same root as Hebrew word <i>יָרַד</i> (<i>yarad</i>), meaning <i>to dive</i>.<br/>
                <a class="map">Odra</a> &lt; *wodr (water) The Illyrian name might have been *Udra, coming into Croatian via Vulgar Latin, where short 'u' merges with 'o'.<br/>

                (spring) The Illyrian name might have been *Arrulia (a river with many springs), coming into Old Croatian via Vulgar Latin, whose 'a' was regularly borrowed as 'o' in Old Croatian and whose long 'u' was regularly borrowed as back yer. The ancient name for <a class="map">Rijeka Dubrovačka</a>, <i>Arion</i>, attested by Pseudoskylax, probably comes from the same root, and so does the ancient name for <a class="map">Dragonja</a>, <i>Argaone</i> (attested in Ravenna Cosmography).<br/>

The name might be even influenced by phonosemantics, because "Una" is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Una_River">name</a> to numerous rivers around the world, and also the <a href="http://www.etruskisch.de/pgs/vc.htm">Etruscan</a> word for stream.<br/>

                So, assuming those etymologies are true, it is, of course, possible to deduce quite a few things about the Illyrian grammar (<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="toggle('ostali')">show/hide details</a>).<br/>

                    Here is what Dubravka Ivsic told me about some other toponyms I've attempted to interpret on this web-page:
                    <span class="quotation" lang="hr">
                        Poštovani g. Samaržija,<br/>
                        hvala Vam na mailu. Otvorila sam Vašu stranicu, no nažalost sada nisam
                        u mogućnosti detaljno se baviti time. Ipak, nekoliko usputnih
                        napomena. Toponimi poput Kalnik, Paklenica, Plitvice ipak jesu
                        slavenskoga podrijetla (za korijene usp. kal, paklina, plit-ak), Essek
                        je jednostavno mađarski izgovor hrvatskoga Osijek, a toponim Jozinci
                        puno je vjerojatnije izvoditi od osobnog imena Jozo nego
                        pretpostavljati "ilirski" *Iasona. Toponim Mariniana sasvim se lijepo
                        da izvesti kao predijalni toponim, (rimskoga podrijetla), od osobnog
                        imena Marinius.  Problem s pojmom "ilirski" je taj što se u njega
                        trpaju svi predslavenski toponimi na našem tlu koji nisu latinskog i
                        grčkog podrijetla, a mogu se izvesti od nekih praindoeuropskih
                        korijena. No, većina tih etimologija je "ad hoc", t.j. nema se s čime
                        usporediti. Osim toga, "ilirski" toponimi su k nama dospjeli kroz
                        latinski ili grčki filtar, pa mi zapravo ne znamo koji je bio njihov
                        izvorni lik. Zbog toga ne možemo biti sigurni niti kako treba
                        analizirati toponime, npr. Vaša analiza An-da-ut-on- ili ipak
                        An-daut-on-ia. Zato u istraživanju toponima predslavenskoga podrijetla
                        treba biti iznimno oprezan, a metodološki ispravan početak svakako je
                        analiza povijesnih potvrda toponima. O mnogima od tih problema pisala
                        sam u svojoj disertaciji, a upućujem Vas i na stariju literaturu o
                        ilirskom (Krahe i Mayer).<br/><br/>

		A question I often get asked is how I know I'm not a victim of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday Paradox</a>, that it's not that the toponyms came from unrelated languages, and that the apparent patterns I see, although they seem unlikely at the first sight, have arisen randomly because such patterns are actually bound to occur. You can see (or hide) my response by clicking <a href="javascript:void()" onclick="toggle('program');setCodeToAppropriateWidth();">here</a>.<br/>
                <span id="program" style="display:none">So, one of the most striking patterns I see in Croatian toponyms is that 5 river names start with k(+vowel)+r: <a class="map" data-look="Krka+river,+Hrvatska">Krka</a> (once in Croatia, and <a class="map" data-look="Krka+river,+Slovenia">once</a> in Slovenia, but near Croatia), <a class="map">Korana</a>, <a class="map">Karašica</a> (2 rivers with the same name, both in Croatia), <a class="map">Krapina</a> and <a class="map">Krbavica</a>. So, since there are around 20 consonants in a language, there are around 20*20=400 possible consonant pairs for a river name to begin with. While not all consonants in a language occur equally often, an average language has slightly more than 20 consonants, so we can assume those two errors approximately offset each other out. Let's assume there are around 100 river names in Croatia (it's a safe assumption, since many river names both repeat themselves and have obvious Slavic roots, so they don't count here). What's the probability the same consonant pair will appear 5 times if the names were really random? Let me be clear, we are not asking what's the probability that this particular pattern of k(+vowel)+r would appear in the river names, we are asking what's the probability that any such pattern would appear. This is the equivalent of asking: If you randomly choose a number between 1 and 400, 100 times, what's the probability you will choose the same number <i>n</i> times? So, because of the Birthday Paradox, it's indeed hard to calculate that probability analytically, but I've made a computer program that estimates that numerically. Here it goes in the C programming language (my favorite compiler for C is <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">TCC</a>, by the way, but this program is also easy to compile to JavaScript by Emscripten, you can see it done <a href="birthday.html">here</a>):

}
</span>
                    So, that program estimates the probability of there being a consonant pair appearing at the beginning of the river names <i>number_of_repeats</i> times, where <i>number_of_repeats</i> is entered on the keyboard.<img id="graph" src="Graph.png" alt="The probability of there appearing to be a common two-consonant prefix in certain number of rivers falls rapidly." style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom: 5px; width:50%;"/> The result will vary depending on how many times that program is being run, but it will always be approximately the same. So, here are some example sessions:
<span class="code">1
100.000000</span>
Because the probability of some consonant pair appearing at the beginning of the river names at least once is, by definition, 100% (unless we assume there is a language in which river names are made only of vowels).
<span class="code">2
100.000000</span>
That's because of the Birthday Paradox, although at the first glance it might seem unlikely that some consonant pair appears two times, the probability of that happening is very close to 100%.
<span class="code">3
56.779999
</span>
So, the probability of there being any consonant pair repeating three times is significantly lower than it repeating two times.
<span class="code">4
5.070000
</span>
So, the probability of there being a consonant pair repeating 4 times is only marginally statistically significant.
<span class="code">5
0.260000</span>
The probability of there being any consonant pair repeating itself 4 times at the beginning of 100 random river names is significantly less than 1 percent.<br/>
Taking there to be 6 such river names might be unfair, because the names of the two rivers named <a class="map">Karašica</a> are exactly the same and it's possible that one was named after the other. Otherwise, the probability of there being a consonant pair repeating itself six times in random river names is so low the program can't estimate it:
<span class="code">6
0.000000</span>
So, the P-value of that pattern is indeed astoudingly low (less than 1/10000). I can not only claim that, if those river names come from the same language, there was a word <i>*kar~kur</i> meaning "to flow" with nearly 100% certainty, I can also claim they do come from the same language with nearly 100% certainty.<br/>The probabilities of some other patterns I found are indeed harder to model, but I expect their P-values to be similarly low.<br/>
The most serious objection I get to this argument is that I am underestimating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman's effect</a> (the effect, discovered back in 1951, that it's hard for a computer to encypher texts in human languages, but that it's easy for a computer to compress them, because some letters occur way more commonly than others). You can see my response my clicking <a href="javascript:void()" onclick="toggle('huffman')">here</a>.<br/>
<span id="huffman" style="display: none">The Huffman effect is caused partly by morphology, partly by phonology, and partly by syntax. In toponyms, we can ignore the effects of morphology and syntax. The extent to which the syntax of a language is responsible for the Huffman's effect is fairly easy to measure, here is a program that can be used for that:

</span>The program will take some 10 seconds to execute on a modern computer. If you put a long English text in the file <i>text.txt</i>, it prints that the probability of choosing the same consonant two times in a row equals 1/11, and that the most common consonant in English is <i>t</i> (presumably because of the meaningless words that need to be there because of the English syntax, such as <i>the</i>, <i>it</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>than</i>...). Yet, if you eliminate the syntax of the language, by putting a spell-checker word-list instead of a text in the file <i>text.txt</i>, it prints that the probability of choosing the same consonant two times in a row is 1/13, and that the most common consonant in that word list is <i>r</i> (presumably because of the extremely common English prefix <i>re-</i> and the even more common English suffix <i>-er</i>). I hope you see why I think that, if you eliminate both the morphology and syntax, the letter frequency will become quite uniform. And the same goes for Croatian: the probability of choosing the same consonant two times in a row in a Croatian text is 1/13, and the probability of choosing the same consonant in a Croatian word-list is 1/14 (in both cases, the most common consonant is <i>n</i>, presumably because of the common Croatian prefixes). For German, the respective probabilities are 1/12 in a text and 1/15 in a word-list, and the most common consonant is again <i>n</i> in both cases. It's indeed hard to measure the effects of phonology, but you can see why I think that we are not very far off if we assume the probability will be around 1/20. I am happy to be proven wrong about this!<br/></span></span>

                Here are the
                sound changes I propose happened from Proto-Indo-European to
                Illyrian:<br/>
                [k<sup>w</sup>]&gt;k<br/>
                [k<sup>j</sup>]m&gt;y<br/>
                [k<sup>j</sup>]&gt;k<br/>
                [b<sup>h</sup>]a&gt;p<br/>
                [b<sup>h</sup>]&gt;β<br/>
                [g<sup>j</sup>]&gt;gh<br/>
                [l]s&gt;s<br/>

                C[l]C&gt;il (perhaps not between all consonants)<br/>
                0[H]C&gt;e<br/>
                So,
                because of the epenthetic vowel 'e' appearing only in the first
                syllable (Ervenica), I suggest that the stress was always on the first syllable.
                I also have a temptation to think that the nominative singular
                actually ended in -i in Illyrian. The suffix -i- is seen in,
                for instance, Serapia, Krndija,
                Colapis, and possibly also in Andautonia. I believe that the primary
                ablaut changed from e/o in PIE to a/u in Illyrian, for instance,
                in the toponyms such as Mursa, Marsonia and Mariniana. The geminates (long consonants, they don't exist in English, but they existed in Latin and were written as double consonants) in
                the toponyms such as Issa and Pannonia are probably explicable by
                some consonants being doubled after a short vowel, like in Middle English
                more or less. It's not quite clear what sound changes the Proto-Indo-European syllabic 'l'
                (and therefore probably other syllabic consonants) had undergone. It appears to have been
                retained after a 'w' (Vuka, Ulciria), but not after a 'd' (Dilj), where it appears to
                have been turned into 'il'. The 'e' turning to 'i' if followed by r+consonant was happening
                in the very late stages of Illyrian, the name <i>C<b>e</b>rtissia</i> is attested in the Antonine Itinerary as
                <i>C<b>i</b>rtisia</i>, and the name <i>S<b>i</b>rmium</i> is attested by Polemius Sylvius as <i>S<b>e</b>rmium</i>.
                The <i>g</i> sound, as far as I know, hasn't been attested in any Illyrian name, and it's possible all the Proto-Indo-European velars merged into one sound. However, this is, among Indo-European languages, unattested, and is therefore unlikely, and the lack of <i>g</i> in attested words and names is probably a coincidence. I think the most common consonants in Illyrian were <i>s</i> and <i>l</i>, for the element <i>*sal~sol</i> appears in at least three meanings: something related to rivers (the ancient name for <a class="map">Jadro River</a> was <i>Sallia</i>, and there are three hydronyms <i>Zala</i> in Slovenia: one is the river that flows from the <a class="map" data-look="Szalafo,+Hungary">Fekete To</a> lake on the border with Hungary, one is the river with the waterfall called <a class="map" data-look="Kotel+Waterfall,+Slovenia">Kotel</a>, and one is a stream near <a class="map" data-look="Železniki,+Slovenia">Železniki</a>), in the word probably meaning exactly "island" (attested in ancient name for <a class="map">Šolta</a>, <i>Solenta</i>, in all likelihood related to the Latvian word <i>sala</i> meaning <i>island</i>), and in the word meaning "salty", attested in the ancient name for the Messapian salt lake <a class="map" data-look="Saline+di+Margherita+di+Savoia">Salpi</a>, <i>Salapia</i>, and perhaps in the toponym <a class="map">Sali</a> near the <a class="map">salt lake Mir</a>. I think the word <i>*sal</i> in the meaning <i>river</i> is a borrowing from Pelasgian, because one of the ancient names for the river <a class="map" data-look="Peneus+river,+Greece">Peneus</a> in Greece was <i>Σαλαμβριας</i>. It's likely that, under some conditions, Indo-European *s turned to the <i>ʃ</i> (<i>sh</i> in <i>ship</i>) sound in Illyrian, because Pseudo-Scylax wrote the name <i>Solenta</i> as <i>Holynta</i>, and it's a lot more likely somebody would hear the <i>ʃ</i> sound as <i>h</i> than the <i>s</i> sound as <i>h</i>. However, since neither Latin alphabet nor the Greek alphabet had a letter for the <i>ʃ</i> sound, it's hard to tell under what conditions Illyrian <i>s</i> turned to <i>ʃ</i>.<br/>
                So, here is what I think <a href="http://linguistforum.com/linguist%27s-lounge/pater-noster-in-proto-indo-european/">Pater Noster</a> might have sounded like in Illyrian:<br/>

                That would be it! If you want to discuss my theory, go to the "Croatian Toponyms" forum thread I've linked to on the left. I'd like to have some sane opposition there, because I think my interpretation may be right. Ideas are correct or incorrect independent of their creators. The fact that I am not a linguist specializing in those things doesn't mean my ideas are wrong. I've used the methods that are well-accepted in linguistics, I've just come to the conclusions that are different from the mainstream ones.</div>
