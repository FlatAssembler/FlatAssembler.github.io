        <br />The first programmer is said to be Ada Lovelace, an English
        mathematician and writer (a woman!). In 1842, she wrote a program for a
        computer called Analytical Engine. However, that program never worked,
        because the computer it was written for was never finished.<br /><br />The
        inventor of modern computer is said to be Konrad Zuse. In 1936, he made
        a computer called Z1. At the end of the 20th century, his ideas were
        reconsidered, and his computer was proven to be about as computationally
        powerful as the modern computers are. He was so advanced that he wasn't
        understood in his time.<br />

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
        So, why am I interested in informatics? Becuase it works! I see that if
        I write something in one of the so-called programming languages, a
        computer understands me. Sometimes it's hard to understand a computer,
        and it's often hard to make yourself understood by a computer, but
        that's because computers are different from human beings. They can
        easily do things human beings have no hope of doing, like displaying
        animations (which is basically drawing tens of images per second).<br />So,
        what are programming languages? Well, see, computers natively understand
        only machine code, made of ones and zeros. It's very hard for us to
        understand the language of ones and zeros. For similar reasons,
        computers have a very hard time understanding the human languages.
        That's why we needed to invent some special languages both humans and
        computers could understand. These are called programming languages.
        There are programs that translate the programming languages to ones and
        zeros, these are called compilers and interpreters.<br />So, what are
        programming languages like? Well, there are two basic types of
        programming languages. One are the so-called imperative languages, and
        the others are called declarative languages. An example of an imperative
        language is C++, and an example of a declarative language is Haskell.
        <a href="http://cpp.sh">Here</a> is an on-line compiler for C++, and
        <a href="https://www.haskell.org">here</a> is an on-line interpreter for
        Haskell. In declarative languages, the sentences would mostly translate
        to human languages as strict mathematical definitions, and in imperative
        languages, they would mostly translate as imperatives.<br />To explain
        the difference between the programming languages, I will use the
        following example of a simple program. Leonardo from Pisa, also known as
        Fibonacci, was a mathematician who introduced the Arabic numerals to
        Europe. He lived in the 12th and the 13th century. He has worked on many
        natural sciences. One of the questions he asked himself was how fast
        woud rabbits procreate if there was enough food for every single of
        them. So he did some experiments. What he found out was that there was
        indeed a rule. Namely, the number of rabbits in some generation is equal
        to the sum of the numbers of the rabbits in the previous two
        generations. For instance, if there are three rabbits in the current
        generation, and there had been two rabbits in the previous generation,
        there will be five rabbits in the next generation. From then on, the
        sequence of the numbers in which each one is equal to the some of the
        previous two is called the Fibonacci sequence. The zeroth number in that
        sequence is defined to be zero, and the first one to be one. So, that
        sequence goes like this: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21... We want to make a
        program to find some number that's far in that sequence (ignoring the
        obvious fact that that number would be far larger than the actual number
        of rabbits in nature because, well, once there are many of them, some of
        them will die before they procreate either because of the predators or
        the starvation).<br />So, how will we do it in Haskell? We just need to
        translate a strict mathematical definition of the Fibonacci's sequence
        to it. "Fibonacci's sequence is a sequence of integers (whole numbers).
        The zeroth number in that sequence is zero. The first one is one. For
        every other number, its Fibonacci's number is equal to the sum of the
        two right before it." Here we go:

</pre>
        If you study the code (a set of sentences in a programming language), I
        believe it will become clear that it's a literal translation of the four
        sentences, every in their own row.<br />Now, how will we translate that
        to C++? We can't do it literally. We need to make an algorithm, a
        sequence of instructions a computer has to follow in order to calculate
        it. A concept you probably need to understand for that is called
        variables. Variables are readable and writable places in memory a symbol
        is assigned to. They can store various pieces of information, in this
        case, they will store whole numbers. So, in C++, when you say
        <i>int a;</i> that means "create a variable that stores integers (<i
          >int</i
        >
        means integer) and assign it the symbol 'a'." (the semicolon, in this
        case, marks the end of a sentence). Now, if you say <i>a=5;</i>, that
        means "Store the number 5 in the variable 'a'." If, after that, you say
        <i>a=a+5</i>, that means "Store the number a+5=5+5 (since we previously
        stored the number 5 into 'a')=10 into 'a'". So, what we will do is to
        make a program that will have two variables, 'a' and 'b'. In the
        beginning, 'a' will be zero and 'b' will be one. Now, we will add 'a' to
        'b', and we will then assign the difference between 'b' and 'a' to 'a'.
        And we will repeat it 'n' times, the number of the Fibonacci's number we
        are trying to find. Then we will say that 'a' is the <i>n</i>th
        Fibonacci's number. Let's say we want to find the third Fibonacci's
        number. So, in the zeroth step 'a' is 0 and 'b' is '1'. In the first
        step, b=a+b=0+1=1, and a=b-a=1-0=1. In the second step, b=a+b=1+1=2, and
        a=b-a=2-1=1. And in the third step, b=a+b=1+2=3 and a=b-a=3-1=2. There
        we go, we will say that the solution is a=2. In C++, we say that we
        "return" 'a' (that phrase makes sense once you look deeper into the
        language). The usual way of saying you want to repeat something 'n'
        times in C++ is to say something that would literally translate as "For
        every integer 'i' from zero that's smaller than 'n', increasing 'i'
        every time by one, do...". Without further ado, here is the code:
        <pre
          style="
            font-family: 'Lucida Console', 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

        A bit puzzling? Well, see, C++ is actually way easier to understand by a
        computer than Haskell is. Also, it gives the programmers more control
        over their programs. In Haskell, they tell the computer what to do, and
        in C++, they tell it how to do that. So, they can ensure they do it in
        an efficient way. Today, you still can't trust the compiler to do it for
        you.<br />Imperative languages are divided into the so-called higher and
        lower imperative languages. C++ is a higher imperative language. Lower
        imperative languages are rarely used today. They are hard to understand
        by a human, but easier to understand by a computer. An example of a
        lower imperative language is Assembly. It has, unlike Haskell or C++,
        many dialects. In fact, in general, each Assembly compiler has its own
        dialect of Assembly. So, an Assembly program that works on Windows
        doesn't work on Linux even if you have an Assembly compiler for Linux. A
        dialect of Assembly I am somewhat familiar with is Flat Assembler. Here
        is what the program would look like in Flat Assembler:

        As you've probably guessed, this is not a literal translation from C++.
        That's because it can't be. I can't really explain this program simply.
        <span class="inline_code">eax</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">ecx</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">edi</span> are the so-called registers. They
        are like variables, except that they aren't in the memory of a computer,
        but in the processor. <span class="inline_code">mov eax,0</span> would
        translate to C++ as <span class="inline_code">eax=0;</span>, and
        <span class="inline_code">add eax,ebx</span> would translate to
        <span class="inline_code">eax=eax+ebx;</span>.
        <span class="inline_code">xchg eax,ebx</span> has no equivalent in C++,
        it means "Let <span class="inline_code">eax</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span> exchange the numbers stored in
        them". For instance if <span class="inline_code">eax</span> was 0 and
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span> was 1 before that sentence, after
        that sentence <span class="inline_code">eax</span> would be 1 and
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span> would be 0. The words such as
        <span class="inline_code">mov</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">add</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">xchg</span> are called mnemonics.
        <span class="inline_code">loop1:</span>
        creates a symbol for a place in a program called
        <span class="inline_code">loop1</span>.
        <span class="inline_code">loop loop1</span> means "If the number stored
        in <span class="inline_code">ecx</span> is bigger than 0, turn the
        execution of the program back to
        <span class="inline_code">loop1</span> (so that the two sentences
        between the <span class="inline_code">loop1:</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">loop loop1</span> repeat themselves, creating
        a <i>loop</i>)." We say that <span class="inline_code">loop</span> jumps
        to <span class="inline_code">loop1</span>.
        <span class="inline_code">.global fibonacci</span> tells the compiler
        (actually a program beside the compiler called "linker") that
        <span class="inline_code">fibonacci</span> isn't a place where you can
        "jump" on, but a name of a subprogram. So, before another part of a
        program starts this subprogram, it should store the number whose the
        Fibonacci's number it wants in <span class="inline_code">edi</span> (if
        it wants the fifth Fibonacci's number, it should store 5 in
        <span class="inline_code">edi</span>), and this subprogram should return
        the result in <span class="inline_code">eax</span>. I hope I've given
        you some basic idea what the lower imperative language are like.

        ><br />
        Today, most of the programs are written in higher imperative languages
        like C++. We've gone an enormously long way from writing the programs in
        ones and zeros. There are two main streams of attempts to make the
        programming languages more productive. One is to make declarative
        languages, and the other is to keep the languages imperative, but to
        change their grammar to resemble the grammars of human languages more
        (like the word order usually being subject-verb-object), and that's
        called object-oriented programming.<br />The first one appears to be
        more scientific. It often does the experiments to determine whether a
        particular feature makes programming languages more productive. But it's
        hard to tell because this field of informatics, the comparisons of the
        programming languages, is filled with pseudosciences. Programmers are
        often quite dogmatic in defending their favorite programming
        languages.<br />
        While I have a lot of theoretical knowledge of programming, I don't have
        experience with writing long programs. The most complicated thing I've
        made is probably the PacMan game I've posted on this site. It's written
        mostly in Javascript, it's around 550 lines long, and I had to solve a
        lot of algorithmic problems. I've come to an idea to make this website
        when I learned how much Javascript (a programming language used by
        Internet browsers) has changed since I last studied it. It's made making
        websites, web applications and games much easier.<br />Everything on
        this website, including the animations and the game, is hand-written in
        HTML5 (a common name for CSS, Javascript and HTML). I haven't used any
        special web-designing tools nor frameworks. Looking at the source code
        of this website might help you study the HTML5, especially since I am
        still relatively a beginner (not knowing the "dirty tricks").<br />I
        hope that it will have some educational value. If you like the way I
        designed this website, you can make one that looks similar to mine by
        downloading the template I've designed
        <a href="template.html">here</a> (I'll warn you that you will probably
        want to dodge it to work better in Safari on iPhone, I haven't bothered
        to make all the features available in a browser full of quirks and
        without the developer tools allowing me to explore them).<br /><br />
        <br />UPDATE on 10/02/2018: I've just made a simple

        browser. I hope that playing with it will be useful in understanding how
        the programming languages work. If you are going to experiment with
        Assembly, you should probably use some virtualization software to
        protect the critical software on your computer from the damage
        poorly-written or malicious Assembly programs can do. You can read about
        my experience with free virtualization software
