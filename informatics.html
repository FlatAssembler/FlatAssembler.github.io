        <br />The first programmer is said to be Ada Lovelace, an English
        mathematician and writer (a woman!). In 1842, she wrote a program for a
        computer called Analytical Engine. However, that program never worked,
        because the computer it was written for was never finished.<br /><br />The
        inventor of modern computer is said to be Konrad Zuse. In 1936, he made
        a computer called Z1. At the end of the 20th century, his ideas were
        reconsidered, and his computer was proven to be about as computationally
        powerful as the modern computers are. He was so advanced that he wasn't
        understood in his time.<br />

          Don't expect it to be so easy. I have been trying to learn to program
          for 8 years now and I still have not managed to get an entry-level
          job. This applies to many things in life: beware of the survivorship
          bias. Don't listen just to the success stories, listen also to those
          who did not succeed. If you listen only to the success stories, you
          will have a very mistaken picture of reality.

          I have spent much of my time preparing for programming competitions
          such as Infokup and the Croatian Open Competition in Informatics. I
          thought they will make me a competent programmer. Not only did they
          not make me a competent programmer, they might even have made me worse
          <i
            >(as they encourage bad programming practices, such as short
            variable names, and give people bad instincts that, if a program is

          learning about relevant things and building it. As it turns out, no
          employer is impressed by such things these days. The barrier to entry
          to the world of programming is high, and it gets even higher as the
          time passes (and computers become more complicated, and an average
          person is more able to build a website so more is expected from a
          programmer...).

        And do not expect universities to help you with programming
        significantly. Let me tell you an anecdote from my experience studying
        computer science at the university:
        <i
          >During the summer break, my father asked me which courses I have the
          next semester. I was naming the courses, and, when I said
          "object-oriented programming", my father interrupted me and said "How?
          Object-oriented programming? A really weird name. And, is there then
          some subject-oriented programming?" I said that, as far as I know,
          there isn't. Then my father said: "I guess that's something that we
          historians can't understand. No, that, on Croatian language, that's
          not a good name.". After a few weeks, we met with some old friend of
          his. And my father told me: "So, tell him, what's the name of the
          course you have this semester.". So, I repeated: "object-oriented
          programming". And then my father asked him: "So, what does that name
          mean? Can you guess? Well, can you think of a name that's more
          stupid?". And the friend of my father said: "Well, I guess it's called
          object-oriented because programming is usually done by mathematicians
          and people from natural sciences. If programming were done by
          historians or poets, then it would be called subject-oriented
          programming.".</i

        I hope you get some idea how difficult it is to study computer science
        at the university. And it is important to understand that programming
        which is done at the university has little to do with programming in
        real life. Studying computer science at the university will familiarize
        you with computer science, electrical engineering (If you do not know
        what is electrical engineering, here is

        your time with things such as getting your web-app to work in Internet
        Explorer, or something equivalent to that in parts of programming not
        related to web-apps (The thing that bothers me with making the compiler
        for my programming language right now is that, after I added the

        >. What you will spend most of your time dealing with when programming
        are those annoying little things about programming tools that have
        little or nothing to do with the problem you are trying to solve. While
        stuff in programming languages such as portability, compiler warnings
        and exceptions are good things, you need to understand that, quite
        often, they are illusory and lulling programmers into false sense of
        security. A program that compiles and works in one C++ compiler can very
        well not even compile in another one, yet alone work. And it is also
        like that with Java. Java is supposed to be a
        compile-once-run-everywhere language, but a lot better description is
        compile-once-debug-everywhere. In theory, if you are triggering
        undefined behaviour, the C++ compilers should give you a warning. In
        reality, often enough for that to be a problem, none of them will end up
        warning you,
        <a
          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/AECforWebAssembly/blob/9653c623bdd713f164482fee1ff7cdd5d0972d80/compiler.cpp#L946"
          >as has happened in my case</a
        >. In theory, if your program is misusing the C++ standard library, the
        C++ standard library should throw an exception, and that is what
        exceptions in programming languages are for. In reality, unless you know
        how the C++ standard library works in the smallest details, what will
        sooner or later happen is that your program will appear to work except
        for

          compiler</a
        >, on an operating system under which the debugging tools you know how
        to use are not working. And there are reasons why C++ compilers and
        standard library are so permissive. The first reason is that there is a
        bunch of bad code already present in C++ projects, and compilers which
        complain about them will be perceived as faulty. I know how annoyed I
        feel when I try to build from source an older open-source C++ project
        with a modern C++ compiler and get tons of error messages, while using
        an older C++ compiler works. There is, unfortunately, an incentive not
        to fix ages-old bugs in programming languages and programming tools. The
        second reason is that C++ compilers and standard libraries need to make
        trade-offs between catching errors and being fast enough for correct
        programs that need high performance and fast compilation times. These
        are problems with computers that have nothing to do with computer
        science, yet alone mathematics or engineering, but which programmers
        need to deal with every day.). You will gain next-to-no experience with
        that at the university, as the programming tools used at the university
        are different from the programming tools used in real life. JavaScript,
        for example, is taught very little at the university, and it is the most
        popular programming language these days, and will likely remain so in
        the future. Not because it is a good language, in fact, it is widely
        agreed to be an exceptionally poorly designed language, full of quirks
        which programmers need to spend a lot of time learning to use it
        effectively. It is the most popular programming language because of the
        technicallity that, in order to make your application run in an Internet
        browser, for most of the time the Internet has existed, there was no
        alternative. WebAssembly will replace a part of JavaScript, but probably
        not most of it. At the university, you will gain a lot of experience
        with programming languages such as MatLab, which is almost never used
        for software development in the real world, and is also very different
        from the languages used in the real world. My perception is that the
        knowledge that is gained at the university helps only when dealing with
        stuff such as nuclear reactors or medical devices. In those cases, it is
        useful to be able to make academic arguments that your program will work
        correctly in unexpected situations. In most other cases, though,
        knowledge that is gained at the university is not useful. If you will

        at the university, click

        <span id="universities" style="display: none"
          ><br />I also think that, in at least some cases, programming as it is
          taught at the university may be counter-productive. In our Operating
          Systems classes, we were taught a lot about system calls in Linux and
          Windows. But using those is a big no-no in real-world programs. At the
          university, we are also encouraged to mess with the algorithms. For
          example, to try to find out which sorting algorithm would do better.
          Doing that in the real world is a hopeless waste of time, because,
          even if you think of a
          <a
            href="https://flatassembler.github.io/AEC_specification.html#AdvancedArray"
            >600-lines-long sorting algorithm</a
          >
          (as I have, for the programming language I have made), you are
          unlikely to do better than the algorithm that is built into the
          standard library of the language you are using. Now, I understand that
          computer science professors will generally say teaching sorting
          algorithms is not there to make students write good sorting
          algorithms, but that it trains the <i>algorithmic thinking</i> which
          is necessary for programming. The problem with that is that many
          students will indeed think that they are qualified to write efficient
          sorting algorithms. As well, it is not obvious what
          <i>algorithmic thinking</i> is supposed to be, that studying
          algorithms the way it is done at the university actually improves it,
          and that it helps significantly with real-world programming, which are
          hidden premises behind that statement. Universities also make students
          spend a lot of time studying software engineering practices such as
          object-oriented programming and functional programming. While there is
          evidence functional programming leads to slightly fewer time-consuming
          bugs in software, its benefits are without a doubt significantly
          exagerated. I believe that, at least once, attempting to apply
          functional programming led me into the wrong direction, when the logic
          of my program was correct, but
          <a

          in the compiler for my programming language to be <code>const</code>,
          expecting the error to show up (which it did not). And the evidence
          for object-oriented programming helping at all is very thin. At least
          two bugs in the compiler for my programming language came from me
          attempting to do object-oriented programming in a language which I
          thought I understood, but I did not understand it properly, that is
          C++ (which we were taught at the university). For example, when I
          thought

            >when I did not understand what a <i>virtual destructor</i> means</a
          >
          (and somebody on Discord explained it to me).<br />
          I have read somewhere, and accepted it as a valid thought, that the
          worst types of programmers in a team are those who, when their team
          runs into a technical problem, say
          <i
            >We have this technical problem only because we did not follow the
            academic standards of programming, that are object-oriented and/or
            functional programming. Had we followed the academic rules of
            programming, we would not have this problem.</i
          >
          Saying that is very insulting and also usually false. Yet,
          universities create exactly this type of programmers. Programmers need
          to understand that software engineers are, while not quite in the
          position of medieval physicians, not very far from it. The fact that
          you have a basic idea of how software works (and nobody fully
          understands the software running on modern computers) in no way means
          you know how to fix it. Any more than doctors at the beginning of the
          COVID-19 pandemic knew how to treat COVID-19 patients: it was
          evidence-free zone, in spite of all the knowledge we today have about
          human body and about virology. And suggesting technical problems would
          disappear if only we rigorously followed academic rules of programming
          is only slightly less absurd than suggesting that George Washington
          would have survived bacterial epiglottitis had only few more drops of
          blood been taken from his body.<br />
          I also think the approach to teaching programming used at universities
          is extremely non-pedagogical. To understand why, consider how reading
          and writing was taught in Ancient Rome. In Ancient Rome, children were
          taught spelling of words before they were shown what letters they were
          reciting the names of even look like. I think we can all agree that is
          a much worse approach than both phonics and whole language method, and
          that it is at least partly to be blamed for low literacy in Ancient
          Rome. Yet, programming is taught in an analogous way at universities
          these days. Students are encouraged to study a bunch of theory they
          have no hope of understanding before trying to do anything on a
          computer. We are taught a bunch of the theory of databases before
          being shown the basics of SQL.
          <br />
          To sum up, while there are cases when programming something requires
          knowledge of computer science, most real-world programming jobs are
          not like that. And you will learn about as much real-world programming
          by hanging out on Internet forums as by studying computer science at
          the university. At least, that is my perception.<br />
          In other words, if you can decypher this:<br />

        OK, now we can continue...<br />
        So, why am I interested in informatics? Becuase it works! I see that if
        I write something in one of the so-called programming languages, a
        computer understands me. Sometimes it's hard to understand a computer,
        and it's often hard to make yourself understood by a computer, but
        that's because computers are different from human beings. They can
        easily do things human beings have no hope of doing, like displaying
        animations (which is basically drawing tens of images per second).<br />So,
        what are programming languages? Well, see, computers natively understand
        only machine code, made of ones and zeros. It's very hard for us to
        understand the language of ones and zeros. For similar reasons,
        computers have a very hard time understanding the human languages.
        That's why we needed to invent some special languages both humans and
        computers could understand. These are called programming languages.
        There are programs that translate the programming languages to ones and
        zeros, these are called compilers and interpreters.<br />So, what are
        programming languages like? Well, there are two basic types of
        programming languages. One are the so-called imperative languages, and
        the others are called declarative languages. An example of an imperative
        language is C++, and an example of a declarative language is Haskell.
        <a href="http://cpp.sh">Here</a> is an on-line compiler for C++, and
        <a href="https://www.haskell.org">here</a> is an on-line interpreter for
        Haskell. In declarative languages, the sentences would mostly translate
        to human languages as strict mathematical definitions, and in imperative
        languages, they would mostly translate as imperatives.<br />To explain
        the difference between the programming languages, I will use the
        following example of a simple program. Leonardo from Pisa, also known as
        Fibonacci, was a mathematician who introduced the Arabic numerals to
        Europe. He lived in the 12th and the 13th century. He has worked on many
        natural sciences. One of the questions he asked himself was how fast
        woud rabbits procreate if there was enough food for every single of
        them. So he did some experiments. What he found out was that there was
        indeed a rule. Namely, the number of rabbits in some generation is equal
        to the sum of the numbers of the rabbits in the previous two
        generations. For instance, if there are three rabbits in the current
        generation, and there had been two rabbits in the previous generation,
        there will be five rabbits in the next generation. From then on, the
        sequence of the numbers in which each one is equal to the some of the
        previous two is called the Fibonacci sequence. The zeroth number in that
        sequence is defined to be zero, and the first one to be one. So, that
        sequence goes like this: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21... We want to make a
        program to find some number that's far in that sequence (ignoring the
        obvious fact that that number would be far larger than the actual number
        of rabbits in nature because, well, once there are many of them, some of
        them will die before they procreate either because of the predators or
        the starvation).<br />So, how will we do it in Haskell? We just need to
        translate a strict mathematical definition of the Fibonacci's sequence
        to it. "Fibonacci's sequence is a sequence of integers (whole numbers).
        The zeroth number in that sequence is zero. The first one is one. For
        every other number, its Fibonacci's number is equal to the sum of the
        two right before it." Here we go:

</pre>
        If you study the code (a set of sentences in a programming language), I
        believe it will become clear that it's a literal translation of the four
        sentences, every in their own row.<br />Now, how will we translate that
        to C++? We can't do it literally. We need to make an algorithm, a
        sequence of instructions a computer has to follow in order to calculate
        it. A concept you probably need to understand for that is called
        variables. Variables are readable and writable places in memory a symbol
        is assigned to. They can store various pieces of information, in this
        case, they will store whole numbers. So, in C++, when you say
        <i>int a;</i> that means "create a variable that stores integers (<i
          >int</i
        >
        means integer) and assign it the symbol 'a'." (the semicolon, in this
        case, marks the end of a sentence). Now, if you say <i>a=5;</i>, that
        means "Store the number 5 in the variable 'a'." If, after that, you say
        <i>a=a+5</i>, that means "Store the number a+5=5+5 (since we previously
        stored the number 5 into 'a')=10 into 'a'". So, what we will do is to
        make a program that will have two variables, 'a' and 'b'. In the
        beginning, 'a' will be zero and 'b' will be one. Now, we will add 'a' to
        'b', and we will then assign the difference between 'b' and 'a' to 'a'.
        And we will repeat it 'n' times, the number of the Fibonacci's number we
        are trying to find. Then we will say that 'a' is the <i>n</i>th
        Fibonacci's number. Let's say we want to find the third Fibonacci's
        number. So, in the zeroth step 'a' is 0 and 'b' is '1'. In the first
        step, b=a+b=0+1=1, and a=b-a=1-0=1. In the second step, b=a+b=1+1=2, and
        a=b-a=2-1=1. And in the third step, b=a+b=1+2=3 and a=b-a=3-1=2. There
        we go, we will say that the solution is a=2. In C++, we say that we
        "return" 'a' (that phrase makes sense once you look deeper into the
        language). The usual way of saying you want to repeat something 'n'
        times in C++ is to say something that would literally translate as "For
        every integer 'i' from zero that's smaller than 'n', increasing 'i'
        every time by one, do...". Without further ado, here is the code:
        <pre
          style="
            font-family: 'Lucida Console', 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

    }
    <span class="Statement">return</span> a;

</pre>
        A bit puzzling? Well, see, C++ is actually way easier to understand by a
        computer than Haskell is. Also, it gives the programmers more control
        over their programs. In Haskell, they tell the computer what to do, and
        in C++, they tell it how to do that. So, they can ensure they do it in
        an efficient way. Today, you still can't trust the compiler to do it for
        you. Imperative languages are also more commonly used than declarative
        languages simply because declarative languages feel alien to most
        programmers. When programming in declarative languages, you cannot do
        things the way you are used to doing them. Or, more commonly, you can,
        but it is discouraged (Haskell has a for-loop, but it is discouraged to
        use it because it is not idiomatic). An unfortunate but undeniable truth
        is that, if you designed a perfect programming language (much easier to
        understand both by humans and by computers than modern programming
        languages are), programmers would refuse to use it because it would feel
        too alien.<br />Imperative languages are divided into the so-called
        higher and lower imperative languages. C++ is a higher imperative
        language. Lower imperative languages are rarely used today. They are
        hard to understand by a human, but easier to understand by a computer.
        An example of a lower imperative language is Assembly. It has, unlike
        Haskell or C++, many dialects. In fact, in general, each Assembly
        compiler has its own dialect of Assembly. So, an Assembly program that
        works on Windows doesn't work on Linux even if you have an Assembly
        compiler for Linux. A dialect of Assembly I am somewhat familiar with is
        Flat Assembler. Here is what the program would look like in Flat
        Assembler:

        As you've probably guessed, this is not a literal translation from C++.
        That's because it can't be. I can't really explain this program simply.
        <span class="inline_code">eax</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">ecx</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">edi</span> are the so-called registers. They
        are like variables, except that they aren't in the memory of a computer,
        but in the processor. <span class="inline_code">mov eax,0</span> would
        translate to C++ as <span class="inline_code">eax=0;</span>, and
        <span class="inline_code">add eax,ebx</span> would translate to
        <span class="inline_code">eax=eax+ebx;</span>.
        <span class="inline_code">xchg eax,ebx</span> has no equivalent in C++,
        it means "Let <span class="inline_code">eax</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span> exchange the numbers stored in
        them". For instance if <span class="inline_code">eax</span> was 0 and
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span> was 1 before that sentence, after
        that sentence <span class="inline_code">eax</span> would be 1 and
        <span class="inline_code">ebx</span> would be 0. The words such as
        <span class="inline_code">mov</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">add</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">xchg</span> are called mnemonics.
        <span class="inline_code">loop1:</span>
        creates a symbol for a place in a program called
        <span class="inline_code">loop1</span>.
        <span class="inline_code">loop loop1</span> means "If the number stored
        in <span class="inline_code">ecx</span> is bigger than 0, turn the
        execution of the program back to
        <span class="inline_code">loop1</span> (so that the two sentences
        between the <span class="inline_code">loop1:</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">loop loop1</span> repeat themselves, creating
        a <i>loop</i>)." We say that <span class="inline_code">loop</span> jumps
        to <span class="inline_code">loop1</span>.
        <span class="inline_code">.global fibonacci</span> tells the compiler
        (actually a program beside the compiler called "linker") that
        <span class="inline_code">fibonacci</span> isn't a place where you can
        "jump" on, but a name of a subprogram. So, before another part of a
        program starts this subprogram, it should store the number whose the
        Fibonacci's number it wants in <span class="inline_code">edi</span> (if
        it wants the fifth Fibonacci's number, it should store 5 in
        <span class="inline_code">edi</span>), and this subprogram should return
        the result in <span class="inline_code">eax</span>. I hope I've given
        you some basic idea what the lower imperative language are like.

        ><br />
        Today, most of the programs are written in higher imperative languages
        like C++. We've gone an enormously long way from writing the programs in
        ones and zeros. There are two main streams of attempts to make the
        programming languages more productive. One is to make declarative
        languages, and the other is to keep the languages imperative, but to
        change their grammar to resemble the grammars of human languages more
        (like the word order usually being subject-verb-object), and that's
        called object-oriented programming.<br />The first one appears to be
        more scientific. It often does the experiments to determine whether a
        particular feature makes programming languages more productive. But it's
        hard to tell because this field of informatics, the comparisons of the
        programming languages, is filled with pseudosciences. Programmers are
        often quite dogmatic in defending their favorite programming
        languages.<br />
        While I have a lot of theoretical knowledge of programming, I don't have
        experience with writing long programs. The most complicated thing I've
        made is probably the PacMan game I've posted on this site. It's written
        mostly in Javascript, it's around <del>550</del> 1300 lines long (it
        used to be 550 lines long, but I have added many new things to it over
        the years), and I had to solve a lot of algorithmic problems. (<i

        Javascript (a programming language used by Internet browsers) has
        changed since I last studied it. It's made making websites, web
        applications and games much easier.<br />Everything on this website,

        UPDATE on 14/05/2020: I've just made a program that will graphically
        present Huffman encoding (a primitive form of data compression), you can
        see it <a href="huffman.html">here</a>. I haven't bothered to make it
        work in old browsers. (<i
          >UPDATE: I've made it work in Internet Explorer 11, it was easier than
          I expected. Still, it works in fewer browsers than the PacMan game
          does, because I relied on advanced JavaScript syntax to describe the
          algorithm, and there is no obvious way to do it in old JavaScript.</i
        >)<br /><br />
        UPDATE on 23/05/2020: I've just made a
        <a href="multiplication.html">program</a> that calculates the properties
        of the distribution of the numbers in the multiplication table. I don't
        know how this mathematical distribution is called. It won't work in
        older browsers, and it will be very hard to make it work there.<br /><br />
        UPDATE on 08/08/2020: The Arithmetic Expression Compiler language can
        now be used to target the JavaScript Virtual Machine using
        <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>
        (the textual representation of JavaScript bytecode, which Mozilla has
        been pushing to get standardized). An example of that is the
        implementation of the
        <a href="permutationsTest.html">permutation algorithm</a> written in the
        Arithmetic Expression Compiler language and runnable in modern browsers.
        <br /><br />
        UPDATE on 22/08/2020: I've started a
        <a href="https://redd.it/iehbmj">Reddit thread</a> about my programming
        language. (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 18/12/2020: As well, I have written an
          <a href="AEC_specification.html">informal specification</a> of that
          language.</i
        >)<br /><br />
        UPDATE on 20/11/2020: As a part of a school project, I've written an
        assembler and a simulator for PicoBlaze (a small computer we use in
        laboratory exercises in our Computer Architecture classes) in
        JavaScript, which can be run in a modern browser (relatively modern
        ones, Internet Explorer 11 does not qualify, but some versions of
        Microsoft Edge which cannot run programs written in my programming
        language nevertheless can run that simulator and assembler, and so can
        Firefox 52, the last version of Firefox runnable on Windows XP). You can
        see it
