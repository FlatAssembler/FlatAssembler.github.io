        <br />The pseudoscience that had the most dangerous results were
        probably the Trofim Lysenko's agricultural recommendations. They played
        a major role in the Great Chinese Famine of the late 1950s and early
        1960s. Anti-nuclear movement and global warming denial are similar in
        their logic to Lysenkoism (trying to make nature we do not understand
        accomodate to us instead of trying to minimize our impact on nature),
        and can easily end up being about as dangerous. The denial that massive
        use of antibiotics in the modern egg industry gives birth to
        superbacteria can easily end up being even more dangerous.<br />
        <br />
        Richard Dawkins once said: &quot;<i
          >For many people, science is yet another belief system, as valid as
          any other. But, actually, it isn't so: airplanes really fly, flying
          carpets do not. There is something special about science. Which is
          why, unlike other belief systems, science is worth trying to
          understand it and following it.</i

        <b>UPDATE</b> on 03/10/2021: I have received some criticism on Internet
        forums that this text appears to be intended to slam everybody else as
        pseudoscience except me, and that it is what pseudoscientists do. That
        was not my intention at all, my intention was to make you more skeptical
        of all things outside the mainstream, including me. As well as the ideas
        you come up with that contradict the mainstream science. Outside of
        scientific consensus, no idea is anything more than possibly right. I,
        for example, think
        <a href="Karasica.doc"
          >my idea about collision entropy of different parts of the grammar
          being measurable and useful to prove some etymologies of names of
          places in Croatia</a
        >
        (you can read
        <a href="toponyms.html#english_summary"
          >an English-language summary on my blog</a
        >) has enough probability to be right to be worth sharing, and that it
        is at least interesting even if it is not correct. I am quite certain
        that, even if I am misunderstanding statistics here, my misunderstanding
        is not nearly as severe as that of anti-vaxxers or typical
        pseudolinguists. To judge whether it is correct, use your brain, you are
        probably more objective than I am. But also have a bit of self-doubt and
        realize there are people who know far more than you do about the
        subject, and who are far more likely to be right. Understand also that
        it is sometimes hard to tell who is an expert in some field (physicians,
        for example, know about nutritional science only slightly more than an
        average person), or even if anybody has meaningful expertise about the
        topic (for example, what happens if we try to radically transform the
        society to deal with climate change or a pandemic). And try to make sure
        you are hearing
        <a href="toponyms#hear_both_sides">both sides of the story</a>, and not
        just one which is easier to read (which is usually pseudoscience).<br /><br />

        <h2 id="introduction">What is pseudoscience?</h2>
        Pseudoscience simply means "false science", something which is presented
        as science, but demonstrably doesn't follow the methods of science. Many
        people believe that pseudoscience is basically isolated to specific and
        widely discredited fields, like astrology and numerology. However, I
        would argue that pseudoscience is probably everywhere,

        <h2 id="SCIgen">
          SCIgen - people attribute apparent incoherence to their own lack of
          knowledge
        </h2>
        To understand why, consider the case of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIgen">SCIgen</a>. It's a
        computer program that generates nonsense in the form of texts about
        informatics, using the vocabulary typical for them. Those texts were
        sent to a few well-known peer-reviewed journals. Most of them rejected
        them, yet some of them accepted them. When asked why, one of the
        recensents responded that it didn't make sense to him either, but he
        attributed its apparent incoherence to his own lack of knowledge in that
        particular field of informatics (<a
          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler/tree/master/seminar"
          >Here</a
        >
        is a paper I've recently written about informatics, I can understand how
        somebody might have a hard time differentiating stuff like that from
        gibberish.).<br />Pseudosciences are widespread because of the way
        people react to nonsense: they ascribe the apparent incoherence to their
        own lack of knowledge. And more intelligent you are, more likely you are
        to fall into that trap, because, more intelligent somebody is, easier it
        is for him to imagine that there is something he is unaware of, so that
        something that doesn't make sense to him actually does make sense. This
        type of thinking is as flawed as it can get, but it's very common (and
        perhaps mostly subconscious).
        <h2 id="following_pseudoscience">
          Why many people follow pseudoscience rather than science?
        </h2>
        In fact, I would argue there are reasons why intelligent but ignorant
        people are sometimes more likely to believe pseudoscience than actual
        science. First, pseudoscientists usually have more exciting ideas than
        actual science does. For example, pseudoscientists often claim to have
        discovered a method to reliably tell if somebody is lying to you. Those
        things interest people. Psychologists arguing such methods can't work
        much better than chance? Not so much. Pseudoscientists often claim
        they've reconstructed the first human language. Many people find that
        exciting. They will rather read that than read the linguists explaining
        their methods are contrary to the methods accepted in linguistics (that
        their methods, if applied to rigorously studied language families such
        as Indo-European languages, would lead to a huge number of false
        positives and also to many false negatives). Second, pseudoscientists
        usually have shorter rhetorics than the actual science does. For
        example, pseudoscientists often say things such as that the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"
          >double-slit experiment</a
        >
        proves that
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilocation">bilocation</a> is
        possible or that the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement"
          >quantum entanglement</a
        >
        explains the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a>.
        Now, if people actually read both sides of the story, that is, both what
        the pseudoscientists write and the actual science of the double-slits
        experiment and quantum entanglement, they would ask what drugs those
        pseudoscientists are on. But most of the people don't do that. They
        think that if someone has a short rhetoric regarding something, he knows
        what he is talking about.
        <h2 id="scientists_versus_laymen">
          What makes sense to scientists is different from what makes sense to
          laymen
        </h2>
        Third, though I am not sure if that plays a significant role, sometimes
        what makes sense to a scientist is different from what makes sense to a
        layman. To understand why, consider the following statements:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The ice will melt sooner on a piece of wood than on a piece of metal
            of the same temperature, because the metal feels colder when you
            touch it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The horizon appears to rise with you as you climb, and, if the Earth
            were round, we would expect it to fall. Therefore, the Earth is
            flat.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the Croatian village V&#238;ljevo (pronounced
            <i>VEEL-yev-aw</i>) obviously comes from the Latin word
            <i>v&#299;lla</i> (country house), both the consonants and the
            vowels and the accent match.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Those statements are false and probably incoherent with what the layman
        already knows. The metal of the same temperature will cause the ice to
        melt faster than the wood will for the exactly same reason it feels
        colder when we touch it. The metal at a room temperature is
        significantly colder than our body is, and, when we touch it, it takes a
        lot of heat from our body. A piece of wood, being the same temperature,
        takes less heat because it's a much poorer heat conductor. A better heat
        conductor will, of course, melt the ice faster. The second statement is
        false, because, well, the basic trigonometry. First of all, if the Earth
        were flat, I hope you agree, there would be no horizon in the first
        place for us to make this observation. Therefore, simply yelling that
        the Earth is flat isn't an explanation at all. Of course, those who
        claim the Earth is flat will claim there is some basically undetectable
        (for whatever reason) curving of light upwards, and that also can't be
        considered an explanation.

        Second, if you draw a diagram, you will see that the angle at which you
        see the horizon is given by the formula (assuming the Earth is a perfect
        sphere, which it actually isn't, but that's not so important here)
        <img
          src="formula.png"
          alt="angle=90-arcsin(r/(r+h))"
          style="display: inline; vertical-align: middle"
        />, where <i>r</i> is the radius of the Earth (around 6'000'000 meters)
        and <i>h</i> is your height relative to the surface of the Earth. So, if
        you are on the Mount Everest (9'000 meters height), you will see the
        horizon at the angle of 3.14 degrees. Barely perceptible. Actually, it's
        not even barely perceptible, because, when you are on the Mount Everest,
        the mountains hide the horizon in the first place. Furthermore, some
        optical illusions make it clear that what our brain perceives to be eye
        level, or even what it perceives to be a horizontal level at all, is
        determined not only by the equilibrium sense in our ears, but also by
        visual clues. This is well-known to mountain cyclists as the false flat
        illusion. That makes the difference between eye level and the horizon
        even more difficult to perceive. The fact that the horizon is not always
        at your eye level, however, can be seen in at least two ways. You can
        see it indirectly by watching the sunset sitting down and then quickly
        standing up (the sun stays at your eye level as you stand up, but the
        horizon falls slightly). And you can also see it directly using a device
        with a gyroscope and a camera (such as modern smartphones). I think the
        fact that the horizon demonstrably falls as you climb is a good argument
        against the Earth being flat, you can see on

        whether it works. The third statement is wrong, because, well, the word
        <i>*v&#299;lla</i> (with a long 'i'), borrowed into Old Croatian, would
        give something like <i>*Ba&#783;o</i> (with a short falling tone on 'a')
        in Modern Croatian. Even if a linguist doesn't know the sound changes
        that happened between Old Croatian and Modern Croatian, he still
        wouldn't have expected the word to remain unchanged for more than a
        thousand years. The consonants, the vowels and the accent "matching
        perfectly" (ignoring the sound changes that have occured) is a strong
        (though not a necessary) argument for the words being unrelated, rather
        than related, because the sound changes don't affect individual words,
        but whole languages. A failure of a sound change to affect a word it
        could have affected is what requires an explanation, and not the word
        changing to the unrecognizability due to the regular sound changes. The
        point is, it's very easy for a layman to convince himself those
        statements (and the similar ones) make sense, sometimes even easier than
        it is to understand the true science to the point when it actually makes
        sense. Our senses are unreliable. We witness illusions and
        hallucinations (at least the ones such as dreams) all the time. Even
        when they do give us correct information, it's very easy to
        misinterpret. The science seeks to correct those things.
        Pseudoscientists sometimes appear to exploit those things to make people
        believe absurdities.
        <h2 id="school_knowledge_does_not_help">
          Why school knowledge does not help us recognize pseudoscience?
        </h2>
        So, what do I think, what's a good way of recognizing pseudosciences?
        Well, let me be clear: the knowledge we are taught at school helps very
        little, if at all. We usually aren't taught how scientists know what
        they know, and that, during the history of science, most of the supposed
        discoveries were actually false.
        <h3 id="survivorship_bias">
          How history of science taught at school makes people susceptible to
          survivorship bias
        </h3>
        In school, what we are taught about history of science are, at least the
        vast majority of them, the succes stories. That's not what's going on in
        the real world, for every discovery in some field, there were countless
        people who put a lot of effort and were confident they were right, but
        they got things wildly wrong. Because such things are only rarely
        mentioned in school, schools make us very susceptible to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"
          >survivorship bias</a
        >, making us think that, if somebody claims to have discovered something
        new, they likely have. The truth is, somebody who claims to have
        deciphered some ancient language is more likely to be somebody like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Goropius_Becanus"
          >Johannes Goropius Becanus</a
        >, a man who convinced himself and many others that the Egyptian
        hieroglyphs represent the Dutch language (seriously!), than like
        Champollion. Because, for every Champollion, there were 10 Goropiuses
        that schools don't mention (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith"
          >Joseph Smith</a
        >, a man who thought he discovered that the hieroglyphs represent a
        language related to Quechua, just to name one more of them). If most of
        the experts in the field think you are wrong, and that's whenever you
        think you've discovered something new, you usually are wrong.<br />
        What we are taught at school might even have a detrimental effect to our
        ability to detect pseudoscience not only because they make us more
        susceptible to the survivorship bias, but also because schools often
        make us think we have competences we don't. The schools make us think we
        know how science works, but we are, thanks to the schools, not only
        ignorant, but also have a wrong conception about it. We are, for
        example, being taught linguistics and philology all the time in our
        Croatian language classes, and most of the people think that linguists
        and philologists are people who like to use some confusing arguments to
        discuss what is grammatical or stylistically right to say and what
        isn't. Nothing could be further from the truth, linguists and
        philologists are people whose job is to make testable theories about how
        languages work. But, if we think that linguists and philologists don't
        make testable theories, we see no reason to believe what they say about
        languages. And the same goes for most of the other sciences we are
        supposedly being taught at school.<br />
        Furthermore, because schools do not teach about the most dangerous
        pseudoscience in history that is Lysenkoism, the rhetorics from global
        warming deniers or anti-nuclear people such as &quot;<i
          >CO<sub>2</sub> is plant food. The effects of increased CO<sub>2</sub>
          levels in the atmosphere may very well be positive.</i
        >&quot; or &quot;<i
          >Nuclear energy is too expensive. I would much rather protect people
          from the real danger of energy poverty than from the hypothetical
          dangers of global warming.</i
        >&quot; sound, well, normal to most of the people. In reality, they
        should remind us of Lysenkoism, the time in not-so-distant past when
        people tried conquering the nature they did not understand instead of
        seeking to minimize their impact on nature, and caused massive crop
        failing and famine. Those rhetorics should sound insanely irresponsible.
        Only slightly less irresponsible than the suggestions that we should
        continue massively using antibiotics in the egg industry (as the result
        of that is completely predictable, unlike what a massive increase in
        CO<sub>2</sub>
        levels in the atmosphere might do). But people, because they are unaware
        of Lysenkoism, usually fail to see that.
        <h3 id="false_things_taught_at_school">
          False things taught at school
        </h3>
        Not to mention schools often teach things which are objectively
        incorrect, and sometimes it should even be obvious they are incorrect.
        Like the claim that human beings use only 10% of their brains. It should
        be obvious that is wrong: if it were true, a shot in a head by a bullet
        would almost always be survivable. But it almost never is. Obviously,
        most of our brain is actually necessary for survival (that is mostly
        because, while some animals relatively closely related to humans, such
        as cats, can survive with relatively little brain intact, the
        corresponding parts of the brain in humans have de-evolved and cannot
        take the same function in case much of the brain is damaged), much less
        unused. Or that birds and airplanes can fly because their wings are
        shaped so that air above their wings moves much faster than the air
        below the wings. It should be obvious that explanation is incomplete at
        best: if that were the main thing making birds and airplanes fly, they
        would not be able to fly upside down. There are many other wrong things
        widely taught in schools, though most are not as ridiculous once you
        think about them. But, really, how are schools supposedly teaching
        critical thinking if they are teaching such things?<br />
        It is also important to understand that the school curriculum contains
        some half-truths, things that are technically true, but can easily
        mislead people. A good example of that, in our biology classes we are
        told that the synthesis of every protein begins with methionine, and
        that no protein can be synthesized without methionine. That is
        technically true, but telling students that without telling them that
        too much methionine raises the cholesterol levels is... dangerous, I
        don't know which other word to use here. It can easily mislead students
        into thinking a diet high in methionine is healthy, which it is not. Or,
        in our IT classes, we are taught that antivirus programs protect us from
        malware. But what we are not taught is that antivirus programs have
        false positives (detecting innocent programs as malware), the
        consequences of which can be just as bad as the actual malware. Students
        are being misled to think antivirus programs help us significantly, when
        it is questionable whether they help us at all.<br />
        And I think what schools teach about programming is one giant
        half-truth. Those programming competitions encourage students to study
        useless or even harmful things (superficial understanding of as many
        data structures and algorithms as possible, short variable names and
        other things that help you write short programs fast...). I have written
        a lot about it at the beginning on my
        <a href="informatics.html">Informatics page</a>.
        <h2 id="censorship_not_an_answer">
          Why censorship is not a good answer to pseudoscience?
        </h2>
        Some people advocate government policies like censorship to try to
        prevent pseudosciences from spreading. But, if you know anything about
        politics, you know that what politicians talk makes scientists dizzy. If
        the politicians were able to get rid of pseudosciences, they would first
        do that in politics. To the contrary, American politics is perhaps one
        of the main reasons the Internet is so full of pseudoscience. Namely,
        this isn't something people talk about a lot, but the American
        right-wing politicians (and sometimes also the left-wing politicians,
        but mostly the right-wing ones) hold a pressure on the media to support
        various conspiracy theories, because they are convinced that the science
        is some force of evil fighting against democracy and capitalism (and
        they are so fanatical that they do not see how absurd it is to do that
        if you actually care about democracy and capitalism). In the US, for
        example, it's completely normal to find an article in the newspapers
        claiming that the scientists are in a conspiracy hiding that evolution
        or anthropogenic global warming have been disproved. Why is it talked
        about so little? Well, partly because major social media platforms, such
        as YouTube, FaceBook and Twitter, routinely demonetize, remove from
        search results, or even ban those who are openly critical of the
        mainstream media (making it even harder to find out what the truth is).
        So, people are indoctrinated into that conspiracitory way of thinking,
        and apply it further.<br />
        It is important to understand that, while censorship might indeed make
        it more difficult for conspiracy theories and other pseudosciences to
        spread, it also prevents them from being discussed. For example, Tony
        Heller is a blogger supporting all kinds of conspiracy theories,
        including that the elections in the US are fake (presumably implying
        elections all around the world are fake and that democracy is useless).
        He made a YouTube video full of long-debunked arguments for the 2020 US
        election being fake (many of them repeated from the previous elections).
        I made a video debunking his arguments once again, in hope to wake up
        some people who truly believe that. However, YouTube wouldn't allow me
        to upload it, presumably due to some censorship filter. So
        <a href="https://flatassembler.github.io/software-glitches.mp4"
          >I uploaded it on GitHub</a
        >, where I will arguably have less audience. Clearly, censorship by
        YouTube has really hurt me more than it has hurt Tony Heller.<br />
        It is also important to understand that censorship on the Internet
        pushes people who hold extreme beliefs into darker and darker corners of
        the Internet, where they are far less likely to hear the other side of
        the story.
        <br />I also think the problem of global warming is given too much
        attention to by the mainstream media, at least compared to other global
        problems. Even though extensive farming of cows emits 3 times as much
        methane per kilogram of meat than factory farming does (because cows
        emit a lot of methane when digesting grass, but very little methane when
        digesting grain), it is almost certainly better than factory farming
        which leads to superbacteria (not to mention animal rights issues
        regarding factory farming). I think mainstream media focusing too much
        on global warming, while ignoring other global issues, makes people
        blind to those things.<br />Everyone has to learn to recognize
        pseudoscience by themselves. What actually helps is knowing how people
        discover the pseudoscientific "knowledge".
        <h2 id="ad_hoc_hypotheses">
          Ad-hoc hypotheses - what are they and why they are distinctive of
          pseudoscience
        </h2>
        Pseudoscientists do what's called ad-hoc hypotheses. An excellent
        example of that is given by Carl Sagan. Suppose somebody claims they
        have a dragon in their garage. Of course, you don't believe them and ask
        them to show it to you. He says it's invisible. You ask him to spray
        some color on it to make it visible. He says that won't work because the
        dragon in his garage is incorporeal. So, you ask him to try to measure
        the temperature of the fire in its mouth. He says that won't work either
        and that the dragon's fire is heatless. I've studied many
        pseudosciences, and I can safely tell you, once you get deeper into some
        pseudoscience, that's the type of reasoning you engage in. You don't
        want to do an experiment because you know what the result would be.
        Scientists honestly try to falsify their hypotheses by experiments or
        observation. Pseudoscientists try to make up reasons why an experiment
        wouldn't work. You know, the horoscopes don't work because making one is
        error-prone. If you see such type of reasoning again and again in some
        field, you can be certain you are dealing with a pseudoscience.<br />
        You need to understand that, if you are going to deal with empirical
        matters, you will sometimes have to apply the Occam's Razor and reject
        the models that are full of ad-hoc hypotheses. Because almost every
        empirical claim can be defended using ad-hoc hypotheses, even the claim
        that the Earth is flat. Either you are going to be a radical skeptic
        (thinking knowledge is impossible) or you are going to sometimes be
        applying the Occam's Razor.<br />
        That's not to say the proponents of mainstream science sometimes aren't
        doing ad-hoc hypotheses. For instance, when I went to discuss
        <a href="Karasica.doc"
          >the paper about applying informatics to the Croatian toponyms I
          published in Valpova&ccaron;ki Godi&scaron;njak and Regionalne
          Studije</a
        >
        (you have
        <a href="toponyms#english_summary"
          >an English summary on my web-page about toponyms</a
        >) on Internet forums, one of the first responses I got is &quot;<i
          >Maybe the collision entropy of the nouns in the Croatian language is
          significantly lower than the collision entropy of the entire Aspell
          word-list. Have you checked for that?</i
        >&quot;. That's, if you ask me, a blatant ad-hoc hypothesis: it is
        inventing the reason why an experiment wouldn't work. And it's not on me
        to do some much more complicated experiment (somehow compile a list of
        nouns in the Croatian language) because of somebody's ad-hoc
        hypothesis.<br />
        One of the most unfortunate things about science is that, the more
        science advances, the easier it is for pseudoscientists to make ad-hoc
        hypotheses that sound plausible to a layman. For instance, in ancient
        and medieval times, Flat-Earhters probably couldn't have thought of
        explaining away the distance-between-far-away-places problem by claiming
        we are living in a non-Euclidean space: the concept of a non-Euclidean
        space wasn't known then. Moon deniers most likely didn't exist in
        ancient times for the simple reason that holograms didn't exist back
        then for somebody to claim that the Moon is a hologram. And if the
        Swahili grammar wasn't well-known, somebody couldn't comment on my paper
        &quot;<i
          >Your experiment isn't taking into account the possibility that nouns
          in the Croatian language have a significantly lower collision entropy
          than the rest of the words in the Aspell word-list.</i
        >&quot; without sounding insane.
        <h2 id="scientific_consensus">
          Why is there a lot of consensus in science, but little in
          pseudoscience?
        </h2>
        Now, obviously, pseudoscientists are trying to hide that. They are
        making it look like their hypotheses aren't made up as excuses not to do
        an experiment, but that they actually logically follow from something.
        Biblical literalists claim their make-beliefs about the universe and
        atoms are based on the Bible. A little problem is: the Bible doesn't
        talk about those things. That's why the Biblical literalists can't agree
        on anything. They don't agree even whether the Earth is round of flat.
        Scientists, on the other hand, agree about those things. If people who
        study some field fail to agree on even the most basic things, you can be
        sure you are dealing with just another pseudoscience. Why it is that, if
        you read your weekly horoscope in different newspapers, you will often
        get contradictory predictions? Because astrology is pseudoscience.
        <br />
        However, sometimes I ask myself, are the beliefs I hold pseudosciences
        based on that? About Digital Physics, the two most notable proponents of
        it are Gerard 't Hooft and Stephen Wolfram. What do they agree on?
        Actually, very little. Gerard 't Hooft thinks the universe is a type of
        a computer known as cellular automaton, so that there is locality in it.
        Stephen Wolfram argues the universe is very unlikely to be cellular
        automaton, because that makes phenomena such as Quantum Entanglement
        very difficult to explain, and he thinks the universe is a Turing
        Machine. I agree with Stephen Wolfram, but that is only because I am
        able to understand his arguments, while I am not able to even understand
        Gerard 't Hooft's arguments. What's obvious is that there is little or
        no scientific consensus among the proponents of Digital Physics. I am
        not sure how proponents of Digital Physics would respond to this
        argument &quot;<i
          >If Digital Physics is true, why aren't you able to agree on what type
          of a computer this universe is?</i
        >&quot;. About Libertarianism, the two most notable proponents of it are
        Milton Friedman and Noam Chomsky. But they have wildly different views
        on how the economy would actually work in a libertarian society. Is that
        a sign that Libertarianism is pseudoscience? Proponents of
        Libertarianism argue that it is not, and that this is because
        Libertarianism is not an authoritarian ideology. Namely, they argue
        proponents of authoritarian ideologies are able to give you detailed
        description of how the economy would work if their ideology was
        implemented and even what happens in case of some catastrophy, while
        non-authoritarian ideologies are not. That is why non-authoritarian
        ideologues are not able to agree on the details of how society will
        function without a government. You be the judge whether that makes
        sense. In my alternative interpretation of the names of places in
        Croatia, I am going strongly against the scientific consensus. There is
        a virtual consensus among the people who study names of places in
        Croatia that names of places prove that Illyrian belonged to the
        <i>satem</i> group of Indo-European languages.
        <a href="Karasica.doc">I think</a> (if you cannot open that link, try
        <a href="Karasica">this</a>) that there is only one scientifically
        rigorous argument (by <i>scientifically rigorous argument</i> I mean an
        argument with a p-value) one can make about whether Illyrian was
        <i>centum</i> or <i>satem</i>, and that it argues for Illyrian being a
        <i>centum</i> language. Am I being a pseudoscientist here? You be the
        judge.<br />
        Another example of a lack of a scientific consensus is this. Croatian
        toponyms show sound changes that are, to quote the StackExchange user
        Janus Bahs Jacquet, &quot;<i
          >At first blush, this looks very unexpected [to somebody who knows the
          basics of Slavic historical phonology].</i
        >&quot;. For example, we see empirically that 'o' in ancient Croatian
        toponyms sometimes gets reflected in modern Croatian toponyms as 'i'
        (the Illyrian suffix "-ona" regularly gets reflected as "-in"),
        sometimes as 'u' and it sometimes disappears entirely (and, apparently,
        it never gets reflected as 'o'). But why? You can read the Janus Bahs
        Jacquet's explanation at the end of
        <a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/46824/20821"

        read the explanation in the Dubravka Iv&scaron;i&#x0107;'es PhD thesis.
        So, we have three different explanations of what actually happened. Are
        we doing pseudoscience here? You be the judge.
        <h2 id="rigorous_experiments">
          Why demanding more rigorous experiments, but never doing ones, is
          distinctive of pseudoscience?
        </h2>
        I also think that requiring more rigorous experiments is a hidden ad-hoc
        hypothesis in many types of pseudoscience. Pseudoscientists often demand
        more rigorous experiments before accepting the scientific consensus, in
        spite of such experiments being unethical to do. Anti-vaxxers are often
        demanding that we make a large-scale study to see whether measles
        vaccine causes autism. The truth is, such an experiment just cannot be
        done, as it is very unethical to give children placebo instead of a
        measles vaccine which we know works and we have very good reasons to
        think it cannot be causing autism (it would require almost everything we
        think we know about human brain to be false). Anti-vegetarians are often
        demanding rigorous studies showing that saturated fat cause heart
        disease or that heme iron causes colon cancer, to be done on humans.
        Sorry, that is arguably very unethical. And suggesting without evidence
        (or, in this case, in spite of evidence) mice and humans are different
        in that regard is an obvious ad-hoc hypothesis. Furthermore, since
        anti-vegetarianism is often associated with statin denial, and there are
        rigorous studies in humans suggesting statins work in curing heart
        disease caused by high cholesterol, I doubt most anti-vegetarians would
        be convinced by rigorous studies done in humans. Veganism is, for a
        reason that escapes me, often associated with denial that sugar causes
        type-2-diabetes, and I also doubt rigorous studies done in humans would
        convince people holding that belief that they are wrong.
        <h2 id="internet_forums">
          Why Internet forums are not a way to detect pseudoscience
        </h2>
        Now, the Internet culture gives us many clues how to recognize
        pseudoscience. Many of them will guide you right in the wrong direction.
        Many people, who want to hear both sides of some story, go to an
        Internet forum. The truth is, on Internet forums, you are happy to hear
        even one side of the story. If 100% of what's written by those who
        support pseudoscience is nonsense, and 90% of what's written by those
        who support science is nonsense, you are going to have a hard time
        trying to pick the right side.<br />
        On the Flat Earth Society forums, many Round-Earthers make weak or even
        outright wrong arguments, such as &quot;<i
          >If the Earth is accelerating towards me when I jump, why do I feel
          like I'm being pulled downwards?</i
        >&quot; or &quot;<i
          >Why hasn't the Earth reached the speed of light yet?</i
        >&quot;, which are misunderstandings of special relativity. The argument
        &quot;<i
          >How it is that the gravitational acceleration (approximately 9.8
          m/s<sup>2</sup>) measurably changes if you climb on a high
          mountain?</i
        >&quot; is correct (in fact, there seems to be no way a Flat-Earther can
        explain that without contradicting many laws of physics), but it is
        unlikely to be convincing. Many people on the Flat Earth Society forums
        are making this argument: &quot;<i
          >How it is that you can see completely different stars at the same
          time if you look from the South Pole and from the North Pole?</i
        >&quot;. In fact, that's trivially explained if you assume the Earth is
        flat: simply suppose stars are close to Earth. What's not easy to
        explain if you assume the Earth is flat is that if you look at the night
        sky from two points on Earth relatively near each other, you can see
        different constellations, but the common constellations (visible from
        both points) have the same apparent shape. If the stars were close, we
        would expect them to have different apparent shapes due to perspective
        distortions. Many people on the Flat Earth Society forums are making the
        following argument: &quot;<i
          >If the Earth is flat, how it is that birds appear to fly at a lower
          and lower altitude as they move from the zenith to the horizon?</i
        >&quot;, which is a blatant misunderstanding of the perspective. There
        are many good perspective-based arguments for the Earth being round, but
        this is not one of them. And so on.<br />
        Furthermore, in my experience, many people on Internet forums are making
        good arguments, but are incapable of presenting those arguments
        properly. Many people who want to refute Flat-Earthism say GPS relies on
        the Earth being round, but, when asked how exactly, they give some
        incomprehensible word-salad. In fact, GPS is a good argument against the
        Earth being flat, because, if the Earth was flat and GPS was land-based,
        GPS devices wouldn't be able to tell their location with only three
        signals. When you know your distance from three locations, you can
        calculate two points where you might be. Now, if the Earth is round and
        GPS devices know they are below the satellites they are receiving the
        signals from, they can elliminate the point that's above the satellites.
        But if the Earth is flat, three signals would not be enough to tell your
        location, because how could GPS devices possibly know if they are above
        or below the emitters? But people on Internet forums tend to be unable
        to present that argument in such a comprehensible way. Similarly, when
        trying to refute radical anarchism, many people say that the government
        is responsible for the Internet. But when asked why couldn't the
        Internet as we know it exist without a government, they give some
        incomprehensible word-salad. But Internet as we know it really relies on
        there being some sane government regulation. Without the government
        regulation, many ISPs would probably set up their DNS servers to respond
        to requests from all IP addresses, rather than just the IP addresses
        they are supposed to serve (because not filtering the IP addresses makes
        the server faster assuming there is no denial-of-service attack going
        on). That would make it trivial to implement large denial-of-service
        attacks. DNS servers often respond with huge responses to short queries,
        and hackers could simply spoof their IP address to flood the server they
        are attacking with DNS responses to queries it did not actually make.
        But people on Internet forums are usually not presenting that argument
        in a format that can be evaluated.

              program, and I accepted it. Can I still present that program as my
              Bachelor Thesis?</a
            ><br />
            I don't know what is relevant here and what isn't, so I thought I
            will just describe my entire situation.<br />
            I am a third-year computer engineering student at the FERIT
            University in Osijek.<br />
            It was the year 2020. My Computer Architecture professor was afraid
            how the laboratory exercises of the Computer Architecture classes
            would be done if the physical laboratory exercises were cancelled
            due to the pandemic. Namely, we are using PicoBlaze there as an
            example of a simple computer, and he was afraid that students would
            run into all kinds of technical problems trying to run the existing
            assemblers and emulators of the PicoBlaze computer on various
            computers they might have at home (in my opinion, rightly so). So,
            he asked me to make an assembler and an emulator for PicoBlaze that
            would run in any modern browser. In return, he would free me from
            the assembly language exam (meaning he would give me an A even if I
            don't show up at the test) and let me write my Bachelor Thesis about
            that project of mine. So, I did that, you can see my work
            <a href="PicoBlaze/PicoBlaze.html">on my website</a> (I targetted
            Firefox 52 as the oldest browser it should work in, because many
            computers at my university are running Windows XP and are using
            Firefox 52 as the browser). The physical laboratory exercises were
            not actually cancelled, so the original purpose of that project
            was... not fullfilled.<br />
            A few months after I made that PicoBlaze assembler and emulator, I
            got a psychotic disorder preventing me from attending the university
            and working on that project for almost a year. Not long before I got
            that psychotic disorder, I added the MIT licence to my project.<br />
            In the meantime, my work started being used at a university in
            Argentina for introduction to embedded systems. So, recently, I
            received pull requests from a GitHub user named <i>agustiza</i>, who
            claims to be from a university in Argentina where my project is
            used. At first, it started with small bug-fixes, but it soon
            followed with <i>agustiza</i> adding significant new features. I
            accepted those pull requests.<br />
            Can I still present my PicoBlaze assembler and emulator as my
            Bachelor Thesis, or will I run into problems because a part of it
            was made by that <i>agustiza</i>? Do I need to write a new Bachelor
            Thesis?

            Do you perhaps happen to know, what would be the easiest way to
            modify my AEC-to-x86 compiler (you can run the
            <a href="https://flatassembler.github.io/compiler">core of it</a> in

            i486, except relying on the <code>fcomip</code> instruction which
            exists only on i686 and newer. At first I thought I might replace
            <code>fcomip</code> with something like:
            <pre>
fsubp
fist dword [result]
cmp dword [result],0</pre
            >
            But the problem with that is that I'd also need to replace every
            <code>ja</code> with <code>jg</code> and every <code>jb</code> with
            <code>jl</code>, which, given the way the compiler is structured, is
            not a simple task (I'm afraid it's too error-prone). Do you have a
            better idea? Is there a way to push FPU flags (ones affected by
            <code>fcomp</code>) and pop them into CPU flags that would work on
            both i486 and 64-bit x86 processors?

            stanza of the song are:
            <span class="quotation"
              >And I can't help but wonder, oh Willie McBride,<br />
              do all those who lie here know why they died?</span
            >
            How would you say that in Latin? A literal translation from English
            might be:
            <span class="quotation"
              >Et ego non possum mihi adiuvare praeter me ipsum rogare, o Willie
              McBride,<br />
              num omnes ii qui iacent hic sciant cur mortui sint?</span
            >
            However, I guess that's not proper Latin. In Croatian, you would
            say:
            <span class="quotation"
              >A ja ne mogu da se ne zapitam, o Willie McBride,<br />
              znaju li svi oni koji ovdje le&zcaron;e za&scaron;to su umrli?
            </span>
            Which would be literally translated as:
            <span class="quotation"
              >Et ego non possum ut me non rogem, o Willie McBride,<br />
              num omnes ii qui iacent hic sciant cur mortui sint?</span
            >
            But I guess that's not proper Latin either.
            <br />
            So, how would you say that in Latin?

              >Why can't unidirectional speed of light be measured using a clock
              external to both receiver and the emitter?</a
            ><br />
            I know that this experiment to measure unidirectional speed of light
            will fail: attempting to measure it by first synchronizing the
            clocks of both the emitter of light and the receiver and then moving
            the receiver away from the emitter, no matter how slowly, will lead
            to time slowing down for the receiver exactly so that, once we run
            the experiment, the time that the receiver has noted it has received
            the light will be the same as the time the emitter will claim to
            have emitted the light (therefore, it will appear, if we don't take
            special relativity into account, that light has infinite speed).
            <br />
            However, let's propose a very similar experiment: There is an
            equilateral triangle, in which there is a clock with a light
            receiver in one corner, a light emitter in another corner, and a
            light receiver and emitter in the third corner. The emitter sends a
            signal to both the clock+receiver and the emitter+receiver at the
            same time. As soon as the emitter+receiver receives the signal, it
            sends light towards the clock+receiver. Now, the clock+receiver, as
            soon as it receives the signal from the emitter (at the same time as
            the receiver+emitter receives it), starts measuring time. And it
            stops measuring time as soon as it receives the light from the
            emitter+receiver.
            <br />
            What will that time measured by the clock+receiver in the second
            experiment be? I know it cannot be the distance from the emitter
            divided by the unidirectional speed of light, since that would give
            us the unidirectional speed of light then, and I know special
            relativity does not allow us to measure that. So, what would that
            time be then? Will it again be zero? If so, why?

              >Why do most programming languages use the same token for
              <code>EndIf</code>, <code>EndWhile</code>,
              <code>EndFunction</code> and <code>EndStructure</code>?</a
            ><br />
            In my programming language, <a href="AEC_specification">AEC</a>, I
            am using keywords <code>EndIf</code> and <code>EndWhile</code> with
            the same meaning as in SmallBasic, and I am also using
            <code>EndFunction</code> (corresponding to <code>EndSub</code> in
            SmallBasic) and <code>EndStructure</code> (for ending the
            structures). But I have noticed very few languages use different
            tokens for those things. Of the programming languages I know, only
            SmallBasic, Ada and VHDL (with a syntax based on Ada) distinguish
            those things. Most programming languages I know use
            <code>}</code> for all of those things, and those that do not (such
            as Pascal or MatLab or Lua) use <code>end</code> for all of those.
            Why?<br />
            An obvious answer is that using the same token for all those things
            makes the programming language slightly easier to parse. But I think
            that cannot be the main reason. Furthermore, I think that Lua is
            even more difficult to parse because it uses <code>end</code> for
            all those things, but doesn't use <code>begin</code> (like Pascal
            does). When parsing Lua, you basically need to keep track of all
            <code>do</code>-es and <code>then</code>-es at the same time.
            Whereas, when parsing AEC, you can first deal with
            <code>Then</code>-es and <code>EndIf</code>-es, and then, after you
            have done that, deal with <code>Loop</code>-es and
            <code>EndWhile</code>-es.<br />
            The other obvious answer is that <code>}</code> is easier to type
            than <code>EndIf</code>. But I am also not sure that's the case. I
            am Croatian, and I don't even know where <code>}</code> is on the
            Croatian keyboard. If I were forced to use the Croatian keyboard, it
            would be much easier for me to type <code>EndIf</code> than to type
            <code>}</code>.<br />
            I think using different tokens for <code>EndIf</code> and
            <code>EndWhile</code> makes the code significantly easier to read by
            humans. But maybe I am biased, since SmallBasic was my first
            programming language. What do you think?<br />
            (<i
              >Many people on that forum think that the C-like languages, which

              Namely, that my keywords look too much like variable names, which
              may confuse some people. And that people don't like programming in
              &quot;verbose&quot; languages such as AEC for the same reason

              language?</a
            ><br />
            A Donkey Sentence is a sentence that defies straightforward attempts
            to translate it into a formal language, but is nevertheless
            meaningful.<br />
            An example of a Donkey Sentence is &quot;<i
              >Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.</i
            >&quot;, a straightforward attempt to translate it into a formal
            language would be:<br />
            <img
              src="donkey_sentence_naive_attempt.png"
              style="max-width: 100%"
            /><br />
            But that's not a valid sentence ("<i>y</i>" at the end is out of
            scope).<br />
            A correct translation of that sentence to the formal language seems
            to be:<br />
            <img
              src="donkey_sentence_correct_translation.png"
              style="max-width: 100%"
            /><br />
            But it's not obvious how it follows from the syntax of the sentence
            (notice that the translation says "<i>all donkeys</i>", whereas the
            original sentence says "<i>a donkey</i>").<br />
            Given how diverse programming languages are, I am not really sure.
            Can there be such a sentence in some declarative (rather than
            imperative) language?

              >If calculating the p-value post-hoc is meaningless, why is it
              reasonable to believe the Grimm's Law (and other laws of
              historical phonology) is true?</a
            ><br />
            Why is it reasonable to believe that the Grimm's Law is true? How
            can those things be scientifically investigated?<br />
            An obvious answer is that we can take an dictionary of native Gothic
            words and the corresponding Latin words, and see whether Gothic 'f'
            indeed corresponds to Latin 'p' (and other correspondences that the
            Grimm's Law predicts) at a rate greater than chance and calculate
            the p-value based on that.<br />
            However, there are two problems with that.<br />
            First, that, as far as I know, hasn't been done (or, at the very
            least, that having been done is not the reason linguists actually
            believe the Grimm's Law is true).<br />
            But the more serious problem is that that would be calculating the
            p-values post-hoc, which goes against the scientific method. In the
            scientific method, you come up with a function to calculate the
            p-value before you do the experiment. In our case, the Gothic words
            and the corresponding Latin words are known data, as if the
            experiment has already been done. So, calculating the p-value based
            on that goes against the scientific method.<br />
            Yet, almost everybody agrees it is reasonable to believe the Grimm's
            Law is true, or at least an approximation (in the same sense that
            Newton's Laws of Motion are an approximation). Why is it so?<br />

            Christian Scientists claim that disease is not caused by physical

              >"?</a
            ><br />
            Gun control advocates often say that owning a gun makes you
            significantly more likely to become a victim of a violent crime. How
            can that possibly be the case?<br />
            I can see how owning a gun can be <b>correlated</b> with being a
            victim of a violent crime: people who live in high-crime areas may
            be more likely to buy a gun to protect themselves. But I fail to see
            how can owning a gun cause you to become a victim of a violent
            crime, much less make it much more likely (as gun control advocates
            often say).<br />
            I can see how, if you find yourself in a mass shooting (itself a
            very unlikely situation), and you try to stop it using a firearm (by
            shooting the shooter), you can make innocent bystanders less safe.
            That is, you might end up shooting an innocent bystander. But that
            has, as far as I know, never actually happened.<br />

              somewhat-sensible answer being that, if you own a gun, a burglar

              are smart guns, which have a fingerprint sensor and refuse to fire

        </ul>
        So, to summarize, I produced many of those questions, including one of
        my highest-rating ones (about the names <i>Arphaxad</i> and
        <i>Holofernes</i>) by reading some easy Latin text (Vulgate) and
        searching for apparent anomalies. The names <i>Arphaxad</i> and
        <i>Holofernes</i> are obviously transliterated into Latin
        inconsistently, and the question of why turned out to be a very good
        one. One of my question is inconsistent word choices in Vulgate (why is
        Jesus'es grave <i>sepulchrum</i> but the graves of other people
        resurected with Jesus are <i>monumentum</i>), and the partial answer I
        received is that the same inconsistency also exists in the Greek
        original. However, note that suggesting that modern translations of the
        Bible are all wrong about some verse (like
        <a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/q/21335/8533"
          >my question suggesting that Ecclesiastes 9:5 is actually saying
          &quot;<i>The memory they had in their heads is given to oblivion.</i
          >&quot; rather than &quot;<i
            >The memory others had of them is given to oblivion.</i
          >&quot;</a
        >) is not going to fare very well on Internet forums. Another method
        I've discovered for asking good questions for Internet forums is trying
        to translate sentences from English and Croatian into Latin and
        searching for sentences that cannot be translated literally. A good test
        for whether a sentence can be translated literally into Latin is to try
        to literally translate from English and then from Croatian, and, if you
        get different results, that probably means both translations are
        invalid. And sometimes Latin grammar explicitly prohibits a literal
        translation (like of the &quot;<i>Heroes are never forgotten.</i
        >&quot;). Some of my high-ranking questions were about words for which
        it is relatively difficult to find Latin equivalents (like
        &quot;<i>listen</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>land (verb)</i>&quot;). Another
        method of asking good questions I've discovered is to look through
        etymological dictionaries and look for apparent inconsistencies. You
        know, like my question about the Armenian word for foot,
        &quot;<i>otn</i>&quot;. My question about the Scythian word
        &quot;<i>hezios</i>&quot; came to me similarly: multiple etymological
        dictionaries claim it's possible that the name <i>Caucasus</i> comes
        from it. I've also asked some questions about why etymologists consider
        some words unrelated when, to somebody who knows basic historical
        phonology, they look like they could be related (like German
        &quot;<i>Tier</i>&quot; and Latin &quot;<i>fera</i>&quot;), though, for
        some reason, such questions tend to be less well-received. Well, I mean,
        my question about the supposed connection between German
        &quot;<i>Tier</i>&quot; and Latin &quot;<i>fera</i>&quot; got
        slightly-well-received on Reddit, and it didn't do nearly as well
        <a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/q/19199/8533"
          >on StackExchange</a
        >. And my questions about the supposed connections between Etruscan
        words (like

          >my question about whether the Etruscan word for water,
          &quot;<i>&theta;i</i>&quot;, and for lake,
          &quot;<i>tis&#x015b;</i>&quot;, are related</a
        >) barely have more upvotes than downvotes. Some of my well-received
        questions are about confusing features shared by multiple programming
        languages, like my question about requiring a semi-colon
        <code>;</code> after <code>EndIf</code> and <code>EndWhile</code> (I've
        heard some people it makes parsing easier, but I fail to see how that
        can be the case). Most languages using the same token for
        <code>EndIf</code> and <code>EndWhile</code> can indeed be partly
        explained by simplicity of parsing (especially in C-like languages), but
        is still rather confusing. Ironically, the questions you get by actually
        doing programming (because you need help right then) do not tend to be
        well-received on the Internet forums. My question about
        <code>fcomip</code> and i486 was asked years after I made the first
        version of my AEC-to-x86 compiler, after I claimed a few times that I
        completely stopped developing my AEC-to-x86 compiler. I must admit I
        still don't fully understand why that question was so well-received. It
        got more than three times as many upvotes as my question about how to
        make a quarter-ellipse in CSS. Maybe people interested in
        retro-computing are way more likely to upvote an equally good question
        than people interested in web-development. And that question about
        quarter-ellipse in CSS was asked months after I designed and programmed
        my website. And my question about special relativity as well as my
        question about Descartes'es philosophy were produced not following any
        particular method, they simply occurred to me when studying back in
        high-school. My question about the implementation of the ternary
        conditional operator <code>?:</code> also came to me similarly.<br />
        An example of a forum thread that leads to nowhere is &quot;<a
          href="https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=89883.0"
          ><i>What do you think about gun control laws?</i></a
        >&quot;. Discussing such things takes a lot of time, and you are not
        going to get any closer to the truth about whether the estimates about
        how many lives guns save per year (by Gary Kleck...) are
        pseudoscientific or scientific (which is probably a crucial question in
        any discussion about gun control laws). That's not to say a good forum
        question cannot touch religion or politics: it absolutely can touch
        religion, like my questions about the Vulgate (the Jerome's Latin
        translation of the Bible). The suggestion that Croatian word for wind
        should be spelt the same as the Serbian word for wind is spelt
        ("<i>vetar</i>") may also be considered politically sensitive. In the
        USA, perhaps even my question about special relativity might be
        considered politically sensitive by the right-wingers (some of whom
        consider special relativity to be a heresy). Good questions on Internet
        forums can also touch philosophy, particularly the history of
        philosophy, like my question about Descartes'es philosophy. But the
        difference between those questions and question about whether gun
        control is good should be obvious. Not even asking
        <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/q/80100/39879"
          >whether the Gary Kleck's estimate that guns save around 400'000 lives

        >
        is likely to be productive (I received slightly more upvotes than
        downvotes on that question, but the answers I received were mostly
        completely irrelevant). Asking what some groups of people mean when they
        say the things they say sometimes works (like when I asked what gun
        control advocates mean when they say owning a gun makes you more likely
        to be a victim of a violent crime), but it usually doesn't work either
        (like when I asked

          >what Christian Scientists mean when they say death is an illusion</a
        >).<br />
        The only one of my questions that are somewhat related to telling apart
        science from pseudoscience that turned out to be liked by the community
        is the question &quot;<i
          >If calculating the p-value post-hoc is meaningless, why is it
          reasonable to believe the Grimm's Law (and other laws of historical
          phonology) is true?</i
        >&quot;. Namely, in
        <a href="https://philosophicalvegan.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4518"
          >a discussion I had on the PhilosophicalVegan forum</a
        >
        (I wouldn't recommend you to try to read all that, there isn't much
        interesting there), the moderator called <i>brimstoneSalad</i> claimed,
        among other things, that nothing about historical phonology can be known
        with &quot;<i>reasonable certainty</i>&quot; because it is against the
        scientific method to establish a function to calculate the p-value
        post-hoc. They also claimed that the methodology of historical
        phonology, such as discovering laws to explain the apparent exceptions
        to the most obvious rules (Verner's Law...) is &quot;<i
          >a how-to of pseudoscience</i
        >&quot;. Well, I agree that there is an apparent contradiction between
        the claims &quot;<i
          >Establishing a function to calculate the p-value after the fact is
          meaningless.</i
        >&quot; and &quot;<i
          >It is reasonable to believe the Grimm's Law is true.</i
        >&quot;. But I think a lot better answer to that apparent contradiction
        is that &quot;<i
          >Establishing a function to calculate the p-value after the fact is
          meaningless.</i
        >&quot; is not true. If what <i>brimstoneSalad</i> is saying were true,
        historical linguists would not be able to agree on anything (for the
        same reason astrologists aren't). <i>brimstoneSalad</i> had some
        responses as to how historical linguists are apparently capable on
        agreeing on quite a lot of things, which... I don't understand them, and
        I think they are word-salads. And I think that discussion made me
        understand what Richard Feynman meant when he said &quot;<i
          >Philosophy of science is as useful to the scientists as ornithology
          is to birds.</i
        >&quot;, I guess Richard Feynman got stuck in such discussions and that
        those discussions made him say that (mistakenly thinking that those
        discussions are an actual philosophy of science). I was wondering what
        people who are actually educated in the philosophy of science think
        about that issue, so I asked it on the Philosophy StackExchange.<br />
        Of course, the fact that your questions get downvoted doesn't
        necessarily mean they are not well-researched. My question about whether
        anybody has done a study about whether deep orthography decreases the
        entropy of the written language (posted
        <a href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/46473/2082100">here</a

        than my highly-upvoted questions about linguistics (I have done some
        actual measurements there, which I didn't do in my highly-upvoted
        questions). It seems as if, to people in soft sciences, the terms like
        &quot;collision entropy&quot; or even &quot;p-value&quot; sound like
        pseudoscientific buzzwords, which is very unfortunate. I have asked a

        <h2 id="some_myths_about_pseudoscience">
          Some myths about pseudoscience
        </h2>
        Many people say pseudoscience can be recognized by the authors
        expressing uncertainty. In fact, exactly the opposite is true.
        Pseudoscientists usually claim they are certain about what they claim,
        and scientists will often admit their uncertainty. The other thing we
        are often told is that pseudoscience can be recognized by searching for
        reliable sources. Well, let me say something heretical:<br /><b
          style="color: red"
          >Wikipedia is the most reliable source of information on the
          Internet!</b
        ><br />Wikipedia usually lets you hear both sides of the story about
        some issue and lets you make an informed oppinion. Other sources of
        information rarely do that. When Wikipedia is unreliable about
        something, then other tertiary sources of information (that is, those
        written by people who don't have very specialized knowledge of things
        they are writing about, such as encyclopedias or textbooks) are just as
        likely, if not even more likely, to be wrong about it.<br />
        UPDATE on 24/08/2023: To be fair, ever since I published
        <a href="Karasica.doc"
          >my paper applying information theory to Croatian river names</a
        >
        (you can read
        <a href="toponyms.html#english_summary"
          >the English-language summary of it</a
        >), and have tried to discuss it on Internet forums, my view on
        Wikipedia has changed significantly. I still think that what's on
        Wikipedia is very likely to be true, however, now I also think that
        reading too much tertiary sources of information (Wikipedia,
        etymological dictionaries...), and little-to-no primary and secondary
        sources of information, can and does give people a wrong idea how
        science works. To understand how science works, you also need to read
        primary and secondary sources, and not just tertiary sources. Tertiary
        sources almost never discuss p-values, which are the core principle of
        the modern scientific method. I think that many people I met on Internet
        forums are basically reading only tertiary sources of information, and
        that that is why &quot;<i>p-value</i>&quot; sounds like a
        pseudoscientific buzzword to them, and that that is why they reject my
        theories. It is unfortunate, but it shows why tertiary sources will not
        help you understand too much about how science works.
        <h2 id="common_knowledge">Why common knowledge is unreliable</h2>
        Common knowledge is not reliable source of information. There are many
        things that are believed by almost everybody, yet are false. For
        instance, almost everybody thinks that rabbits like to eat carrots,
        while carrots are actually quite
        <a
          href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/rabbits/diet/myths"
          >dangerous</a
        >
        for rabbits. Almost everybody thinks that mice like to eat cheese, when,
        in fact, cheese is
        <a href="http://animals.mom.me/can-pet-mice-eat-cheese-1370.html"
          >lethal</a
        >
        for mice even in relatively low amounts. It's hard to estimate how much
        of the common knowledge is actually false, but it could easily be most
        of it. And pseudoscientists use that to convince people. A good example
        of that could be the anti-nuclear movement using the well-known "fact"
        that Fukushima nuclear disaster killing many people by radiation. In
        reality, the number of people who have died because of the radiation is
        in the low tens, if not less than ten. The poorly organized evacuation
        is
        <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0936655516000054"
          >responsible</a
        >
        for far more deaths than radiation is. But who would have thought such a
        well-known thing from recent history is completely false? Similarly,
        people who advocate meat-based diets (and other low-carbohydrate diets)
        often appeal to the "fact" that Inuits have very low rates of
        atherosclerosis, when they, in reality, have higher rates of
        atherosclerosis than the USA average (and the USA has above
        world-average rates of atherosclerosis).
        <h2 id="how_pseudosciences_come_to_be">
          How pseudosciences come to be?
        </h2>
        So, how do pseudosciences come to be? Well, people come to bad ideas in
        a similar way they come to good ideas. You know when Francis Crick got
        his idea about the structure of DNA while he was on drugs?
        Pseudoscientists are usually way more educated in some field than an
        average person is. Many of them are engineers or physicians (and those
        are people who seem to have tendency to think they are somehow qualified
        to talk about things they don't know much about, especially the
        scientific method). It's not important who says something or how he came
        to some idea, what's important is that they understand the scientific
        method and honestly try to follow it. Pseudoscientists don't follow the
        scientific method because they don't realize why it's important, and
        that it would eradicate the errors they make.
        <h2 id="three_common_errors">
          Three common sources of errors in pseudosciences
        </h2>
        The errors that seem to repeat from one pseudoscience to another appear
        to be ignorance of statistics, ignorance of psychophysics (perception)
        and misunderstandings of the epistemology.
        <h3 id="statistics">Misunderstanding of statistics</h3>
        You know when pseudoscientists try to establish a relationship between
        some two languages, find even less apparent cognates than what's
        expected to be found by chance, and then claim it can't be due to
        chance, usually without doing any math whatsoever? Or when creationists
        claim it's extremely unlikely for a simple cell to emerge from
        non-living matter, without having any idea how to actually calculate
        that? Or, perhaps the most famous such example, when global warming
        <a
          href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3624242/There-IS-a-problem-with-global-warming...-it-stopped-in-1998.html"
          >deniers</a
        >
        seem to think that any straight line drawn between two points on a graph
        is a trend-line? Or when anti-vaxxers claim that the studies that show
        that the number of vaccinated children who die in an outbreak of some
        disease outweighs the number of unvaccinated children who died somehow
        proves that vaccines don't work (despite of the number of vaccinated
        children being by order of magnitude greater than the number of
        unvaccinated children, and despite that nearly all unvaccinated children
        died, while only a small proportion of vaccinated children died)? A
        parody of that argument that kind-of gets to the point, but not quite,
        is &quot;<i
          >Most of the people who freeze to death are wearing a jacket,
          therefore, jacket does not help.</i
        >&quot;. Perhaps an even more appropriate analogy would be if a drunk
        driver caused a traffic accident in which many people died, and somebody
        argued &quot;<i
          >Well, most of the people who died in that traffic accident were not
          drunk, and that means the alcohol could not have caused it.</i
        >&quot;. I do not know about you, but I think it should be obvious that
        by compromising your immune system (for example, by refusing to get
        vaccinated) you are putting everybody at risk, and not just yourself.
        Apparently, it is not obvious to some people (some anti-vaxxers even say
        maintaining a strong immune system puts other people in danger because
        it causes germs to evolve resistance to human immune system, the same
        way preventative use of antibiotics leads to superbacteria - that
        argument is wrong because it ignores the fact that resistance to a
        specific antibiotic can evolve far more easily than resistance to a
        strong and trained-by-vaccines immune system, which is evident by the
        fact that past pandemics such as Spanish Flu burnt themselves out after
        infecting enough people, rather than evolving into an HIV-like virus.
        Even if it were the case, not maintaining a good immune system because
        of that is protecting people around you from a hypothetical danger that
        are HIV-like viruses by putting them into a real danger that are viruses
        that currently exist.). I understand it can be difficult to exercise and
        maintain a proper diet to have a strong immune system. But getting
        vaccinated is not difficult to do. Statin deniers often also make a
        similar argument &quot;<i
          >Most of the people who get heart attacks have normal cholesterol
          levels, therefore cholesterol does not cause heart disease.</i
        >&quot;, as if somebody claimed it was only the cholesterol that caused
        heart attacks (and not also high blood pressure...). During the COVID-19
        pandemic, anti-vaxxers have changed their strategy. The usual argument
        they use today, during the COVID-19 pandemic, is &quot;<i
          >Many more people died soon after taking the COVID-19 vaccine than
          after taking any other vaccine, therefore, COVID-19 vaccinations are
          unsafe.</i
        >&quot;. That argument is not even a misunderstanding of statistics, it,
        in my opinion, contradicts the very basic common sense, to the point
        that I ask myself whether people who are using that argument are being
        serious. COVID-19 vaccination was mostly given to elderly, unlike other
        vaccinations, which are mostly given to pre-school children. Of course
        elderly people are much more likely to die soon after taking a vaccine
        than children are, for reasons unrelated to the vaccine. Oddly enough,
        anti-vaxxers these days also seem to think that &quot;<i
          >The average age of death from COVID-19 is greater than life
          expectancy, therefore COVID-19 is not dangerous.</i
        >&quot; is a valid argument. That argument is also a misunderstanding of
        statistics, but of the let's-say-so-opposite kind: it ignores the fact
        that people who have already lived to the age of life expectancy of the
        country they are living in are likely to live for a few more years,
        rather than to die very soon. In ancient times, when life expectancy was
        around 35 years, that same argument would probably show cancer (and
        other diseases that affect many people today because we live long enough
        to get them, and young people do not tend to get them) is not dangerous.
        A related argument made by anti-vaxxers during the COVID-19 pandemic is
        that since vaccinated and unvaccinated people tend to die with COVID-19
        at a similar rate, that suggests COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective. And
        maybe if the demografic which was vaccinated and one which is not were
        similar, that would be a valid argument. However, considering that
        people vaccinated against COVID-19 are mostly over 50 years old, and
        unvaccinated people are almost all younger than 50, doing such
        comparisons is, just like comparing deaths soon after the COVID-19
        vaccines with deaths soon after other vaccines, comparing apples and
        oranges. A 75-year-old has around 500 times higher probability of dying
        from COVID-19 if they catch it than a 20-year-old has, and, even if the
        vaccine is 99% effective (which it is not), we would still expect
        vaccinated 75-year-olds to die at a higher rate than unvaccinated
        20-year-olds. Also, people who have cancer or heart disease are, of
        course, more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Oddly enough,
        when arguing for deaths from COVID-19 being overcounted (which they may
        very well be, especially now when deaths from undiagnozed COVID-19 are
        probably exceedingly rare), anti-vaxxers emphasize the difference
        between deaths with COVID-19 and deaths from COVID-19, while, when
        arguing that vaccines are ineffective, that distinction somehow
        disappears in their mind. I think an average person drastically
        underestimates the chance that an elderly person who catches COVID-19
        will die from it and that they also drastically overestimate the chance
        that a young person who catches COVID-19 will die from it. The chances
        that a 20-year-old who catches COVID-19 will die from it is around 1 in
        3'000. Compared with other risks in life (which, unfortunately, cannot
        be prevented by vaccination), that is almost negligible: around 10 times
        as many people in the 20-to-30-years-old age group died in traffic
        accidents in 2020 (which, by the way, was higher than in 2019,
        presumably having something to do with the counter-productive hysteria
        of people buying unreasonable amounts of everyday products in face of a
        pandemic: that hysteria was, of course, leading to shortages, forcing
        people both to drive more and get exposed to germs more) than from
        COVID-19. Chances that a 75-year-old who catches COVID-19 will die from
        it is around 17%. In 2020, COVID-19 killed about as many
        70-to-80-year-olds as cancer and heart disease did together. If people
        do not have the perspective on that, I can see how the arguments made by
        anti-vaxxers can seem compelling. I guess it is also hard to swallow
        that the best predictor of whether you will die in a pandemic (that you
        will have comorbodities such as high blood pressure) is not your diet or
        how much you exercise, but whatever your age happens to be when the
        pandemic comes. There is another family of arguments which boil down to
        misunderstanding of statistics in pseudosciences, and those are exampled
        by anti-vaxxers saying stuff like &quot;<i
          >Autism is rising around the world as the percentage of children who
          are vaccinated is rising, therefore vaccines cause autism.</i
        >&quot; or people who deny saturated fat causes heart disease pointing
        to the statistics supposedly showing saturated fat consumption in the
        USA peaked somewhere in the 1970s while deaths from heart disease are
        more common now than in the 1970s, or people who deny sugar causes
        type-2-diabetes pointing to statistics which supposedly show sugar
        consumption in the USA peaked somewhere in 1990s while type-2-diabetes
        is more common now. Those arguments, although they may seem convincing
        at first, are, in fact, very weak. They ignore huge other factors.
        Autism is more common in children whose mothers were old when they gave
        birth to them, and women today give births older and older. As for heart
        disease and type-2-diabetes, again, there is a huge other factor, and
        that is life expectancy rapidly increasing and more and more people
        living long enough to get those diseases. Furthermore, it is very
        questionable whether those statistics are accurate. Autism may simply
        appear to rise because more people have access to basic health care. And
        dairy consumption and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are
        hardly good proxies for saturated fat consumption and sugar consumption.
        Sometimes I wonder if people using those arguments are being serious.
        People who deny saturated fat causes heart disease usually explain that
        they do not think all science is wrong, but that the tiny increase in
        high-density cholesterol saturated fat cause somehow offsets the huge
        increase in low-density cholesterol that saturated fats cause. Which is
        obviously against evidence (there is little evidence high-density
        cholesterol has any effect on heart disease, yet alone such a huge one),
        but at least it does not sound insane. Claiming vaccines cause autism
        (which the mainstream science says is present from birth) or that sugar
        does not cause type-2-diabetes (which the mainstream science says is
        primarily a liver disease caused partly by fructose and saturated fat)
        is claiming all science is wrong, and that claim is supposedly based
        only on some obviously-horribly-designed studies. In other words, they
        are trying to contradict the experiments via dubious statistics. That
        sounds insane to me. I kind of understand why people are doing that,
        they are (rightly) afraid of government overreach of government forcing
        people to eat whatever government wants them to eat, which would, as I
        explained in my <a href="libertarianism">Libertarianism</a> page,
        probably do more harm than good. But saying, against the overwhelming
        amount of evidence, that saturated fat does not cause heart disease or
        that sugar does not cause diabetes, is not a good way to argue against
        government overreach. Or maybe they want the government to continue
        massively subsidizing dairy and sugar industries. Or maybe they are
        indeed confused by numbers. I sometimes ask myself whether Murray
        Rothbard was right in saying that the government collecting statistics
        is worse than useless. Scientists almost never look at those statistics,
        because they realize they are nearly useless (it is very unlikely that a
        common-enough-to-be-of-concern side-effect of some drug is detected in
        epedimiological studies that is not detected in controlled experiments),
        but those statistics apparently often mislead laymen into anti-vaxxer
        and similar beliefs (that saturated fat and sugar are not harmful...).
        Laymen apparently often do not realize how low the signal-to-noise ratio
        in those statistics is, so they easily convince themselves some pattern
        they see in those statistics is meaningful, and then it is hard to
        convince them it is not (or that it means something else than what they
        think it means, as in the case of increase in the number of deaths soon
        after COVID-19 vaccination compared to other vaccination). If some
        statistics are useless to the scientists and worse-than-useless to
        laymen (because they are often misled by them), the government is doing
        wrong in collecting those statistics. Murray Rothbard was primarily
        referring to statistics about economics (that they mislead politicians
        into thinking inflation leads to lower unemployment, when, according to
        Rothbard, it is low unemployment that causes slight inflation, rather
        than the other way around, and artificial inflation is harmful), and I
        think it applies just as much here, if not even more so (government
        statistics may be the best source we have about macroeconomics, but they
        are certainly not the best source we have about medical science issues).
        I think mainstream social sciences are doing the opposite error than
        most pseudoscientists are doing. I think mainstream social science is
        denying patterns that are unlikely to be due to chance as being due to
        chance because they do not fit mainstream theories in social sciences.
        Mainstream linguistics, for example, claims that the pattern of Croatian
        river names often beginning with k(+vowel)+r is coincidental. In
        <a href="Fonoloska_evolucija_jezika.docx"
          >the draft of a paper I am trying to publish</a
        >
        (<i
          >UPDATE: And in the
          <a href="Karasica.doc"
            >much shorter paper I have published in Valpova&ccaron;ki
            Godi&scaron;njak</a
          >.</i
        >), I have analyzed that problem to the best of my ability, and I came
        to the conclusion that the probability of that pattern arising by chance
        has to be somewhere between 1/300 and 1/17 (which is sensitive to the
        assumptions about the collision entropy of phonology of the Croatian
        language). If my analysis is correct, that strongly undermines the
        mainstram interpretation of names of places in Croatia. Time will tell
        whether I am right about that.<br />
        Given how common misunderstanding of statistics is in pseudosciences, a
        question is &quot;<i
          >How do you recognize when somebody is using statistics correctly?</i
        >&quot;. I wish I knew the answer to that question. But my best guess is
        that it happens when somebody is calculating p-values and arriving at
        reasonable results. If somebody is not trying to calculate p-values,
        that can easily be because they do not understand statistics or don't
        like what statistics tells them (that their observations are likely to
        be due to chance). If somebody is, for example, arriving at a p-value of
        1/10'000 in a very soft field (where you expect p-values to be something
        like 1/20), there is a very good chance they are calculating something
        incorrectly (like I was before I analyzed the problem of Croatian river
        names more deeply). There is a reason p-values are valued in science. Of
        course, there are exceptions. Ignaz Semmelweis, for example, was not
        calculating p-values, presumably because statistics back then was not
        yet advanced enough for that to be common or even possible. Or maybe
        because he thought the patterns he discovered were so obvious one does
        not need a p-value for that. Grimm's Law and Havlik's Law in linguistics
        are also so obvious once you look at the data that one does not need a
        p-value for them (though I am quite sure linguistics would go a lot
        further had it used statistics more). But I still think &quot;<i
          >Look for the p-values.</i
        >&quot; is a good advice for telling apart science from
        pseudoscience.<br />
        Why would you expect larger p-values in softer fields? Well, you need to
        understand that, when you are doing historical phonology (Grimm's Law,
        Havlik's Law...), you are assuming that linguistic classification
        (whether some language is Indo-European or not) is correct. Linguistic
        classification is a harder field than historical phonology, the facts
        from linguistic classification are more certain than facts from
        historical phonology. That's why the p-values is historical phonology
        are larger than p-values in linguistic classification. And, when you are
        doing etymology, you are assuming both that historical phonology and
        that linguistic classification are correct. Thus, when doing etymology,
        you should expect larger p-values than if doing historical phonology.
        Etymology is a much softer field than historical phonology.<br />
        As an example of studies that are arriving at an unreasonable p-value
        (or not calculating the p-value at all), look at most studies about gun
        control. Most of the studies about gun control compare homicide rates in
        some city before and after some gun control law in that city was passed,
        and they conclude based on that whether it was effective or
        counter-productive. While that intuitively sounds like a reasonable
        methodology, it is not. Think of it this way: the vast majority of gun
        control laws only affect the sales of new guns. And there are 400
        million guns already in the US. So, gun control laws only affect around
        1% of total guns in existence. And homicide rates vary by around 6% from
        one year to the next. The signal-to-noise ratio is therefore at most
        1:6. It is extremely unlikely that any such gun control study can arrive
        at a statistically significant result. The famous Gary Kleck's study
        where he tried to estimate the number of lives saved by defensive gun
        use each year at least does not suffer from that fatal flaw.
        <h3 id="perception">Misunderstanding of perception</h3>
        Or you know when the Flat-Earthers say things like that the fact that
        the horizon appears to rise as we climb proves that the Earth is flat?
        Or the conspiracy theorists claiming the photographic anomalies proving
        that the photographs are fake, even though they are exactly as some
        professional photographer would expect them to be? Or when the
        geocentrists and the Flat-Earthers claim that the sunrays not appearing
        to be parallel when the sun is in the zenith proves that the Sun isn't
        far away from the Earth? Or when the conspiracy theorists about the
        assassination of John F. Kennedy claim it is visible from the footage
        the places where the bullet passed through are not collinear, suggesting
        either it was some special kind of bullet or multiple bullets most of
        which are hidden, when all the experts who studied that find nothing
        conspicious there (the holes are collinear, but people are visualizing
        things wrongly based on the 2-dimensional footage)? Those things are
        obvious examples of misunderstanding how our perception works,
        misunderstanding of psychophysics.<br />
        I think that many pseudosciences would cease to exist if
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petzval_field_curvature"
          >Petzval Field Curvature</a
        >
        were common knowledge. Namely, pseudoscientists often imply it is
        possible to see via a photograph whether some huge lines are parallel or
        straight. That's simply not how cameras work: the image that the lens
        produces is curved, while the light sensor in the camera is flat.
        Ironically, naked eye might be a better tool to tell whether some long
        line is straight or curved, as at least the retina of the eye is curved
        like the image that the lens produces. But schools, unfortunately, do
        not teach such things.
        <h3 id="epistemology">Misunderstanding of epistemology</h3>
        Or when pseudoscientists use the Occam's razor as a justification for
        the personal incredulity fallacy? That is a lack of understanding of
        epistemology. Flat-Earthers using the &quot;<i
          >Horizon appears to rise as we climb.</i
        >&quot; argument can also be said to misunderstand the epistemology:
        they are trying to replace the theory that explain at least something
        (the theory that the Earth is round explains away why there is a horizon
        in the first place, and why it moves farther away from us as we climb,
        and many other things) with a theory that explains precisely nothing
        (not even why there is a horizon in the first place). Flat-Earthers also
        often claim the mainstream astronomy incorrectly predicts sunrise and
        sunset times, as if that proved the Earth is flat. But since the Flat
        Earth Theory does not even explain the sunrise and sunset (it invokes
        inexplicable curving of light for that), that is irrelevant to the
        question of whether the Earth is round of flat. Using that argument is,
        once again, trying to replace a theory that explains at least something
        (the Earth being a spinning sphere explains how can there be sunrise and
        sunset in the first place) with a theory that explains precisely
        nothing.<br />
        This should go without saying, but, in order for some observation to be
        evidence of the Earth being flat, it is not enough for it to be
        difficult to explain if you assume the Earth is round. It also needs to
        be easy to explain under the Flat Earth Theory. I think the only
        Flat-Earthers' argument that cannot be debunked simply by pointing out
        that obvious fact from epistemology is the argument &quot;<i
          >If the Sun were really 150'000'000 kilometers high in the sky, the
          crepuscular rays would seem parallel.</i
        >&quot;, as it is indeed easier to suppose the Sun is only a few
        thousand miles up in the sky than to explain the optical illusion.<br />
        Or a less extreme example than Flat-Earthers, people who are denying
        global warming is anthropogenic. Mainstream climate science thinks that
        CO<sub>2</sub> increase in the atmosphere causes a positive feedback
        loop of water increasing as well, increasing the effect of CO<sub
          >2</sub
        >
        by around 3 times. People who are denying global warming is
        anthropogenic generally deny that that positive feedback loop exists.
        And most of their arguments are similar to this: &quot;<i
          >Almost all climate models which predict global warming also predict
          that infrared (long-wave) radiation from the Earth will decrease over
          time. Yet, the satellite data shows that it has increased.</i
        >&quot;... without showing a mathematical model that predicts the Earth
        is warming and that infrared radiation is increasing. In other words,
        they are trying to replace mathematical models which at least explain
        why the Earth is warming with a mathematical model that doesn't even do
        that, just because they supposedly cannot explain infrared radiation
        increasing. That's going against the scientific method. And by the way,
        mainstream climate models aren't really predicting infrared radiation
        will decrease, they are predicting it will decrease slightly and then
        start increasing, and there were no satellites back when it was
        decreasing.<br />
        An error that's common in pseudosciences that also belongs to
        misunderstanding epistemology is trying to use a soft science to
        contradict a hard one. How many times have you heard arguments such as
        &quot;<i
          >Saturated fat cannot cause heart disease, because our ancestors have
          been eating meat for millions of years, so we evolved against it.</i
        >&quot; or &quot;<i
          >Fructose cannot be causing type-2-diabetes, as our ancestors have
          been eating bananas, which are full of fructose, for millions of
          years, so we evolved against it.</i
        >&quot; or &quot;<i
          >Heme iron cannot be causing colon cancer, as our ancestors have been
          eating red meat for millions of years, so we evolved against it.</i
        >&quot;? Such arguments are wrong on several levels. For the first two
        argtuments, we can refute them simply by pointing out the facts that
        meat of wild animals (rabits...) contains way less saturated fat than
        the meat we eat today, and that wild bananas contain way less fructose
        than bananas we eat today. All three of those arguments can be refuted
        by pointing out the fact that evolution doesn't care about diseases
        people tend to get when they are old, as life expectancy was
        significantly lower in pre-history than it is today. Also, what makes
        people who use those arguments think protection against those things
        even can evolve? But, more fundamentally, those arguments are attempting
        to use a soft science to contradict a hard one. Guesses about what our
        ancestors used to eat millions of years ago are way softer science than
        &quot;<i
          >Heme iron mixed with omega-6-acids in the presence of the enzymes
          found in human colon produces carcinogenous substances.</i
        >&quot;. I also think Dubravka Iv&scaron;i&#x0107;, in
        <a href="https://flatassembler.github.io/toponyms#hear_both_sides"
          >her response to my paper about the river name Kara&scaron;ica</a
        >, was also doing this error of attempting to use a soft science to
        contradict a hard one. Informatics is a way harder science than
        historical linguistics, and, if informatics says that the probability
        for the k-r pattern in Croatian river names to emerge by chance is
        negligible, you contradict that using either informatics or some even
        harder science, not historical linguistics. You don't get to use magical
        languages to get around the limits put by informatics.
        <h3 id="why_perception_is_interesting">
          Why false appeals to laws of perception are the most interesting
        </h3>
        I don't know about you, but I find the arguments based on perception
        most interesting. People uneducated about those things tend to have wild
        misconceptions about perception (like the emission theory of vision, see
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_theory_(vision)#Persistence_of_the_theory"
          >here</a
        >), yet they tend to be rather confident their understanding of the
        perception is close to right, and that they are able to evaluate the
        claims made by pseudoscientists. I often find it amazing to think how
        much science has advanced in spite of our intuitive misunderstanding of
        perception. The arguments for geocentrism are so easy to understand and
        tempting. Saying &quot;<i
          >If the Earth were spinning very fast, we would feel that.</i
        >&quot; (The Galilean Principle of Relativity may seem obvious to us
        today, since almost everybody has experienced being in a moving train
        and not feeling its movement, but it was hardly obvious in ancient
        times, and I would imagine most ancient intellectuals would have
        insisted it was not true.) or &quot;<i
          >If the Sun were far away from the Earth, sunrays would seem parallel.
          But, when the sun is close to the zenith, you can easily see they are
          not.</i
        >&quot; or &quot;<i
          >If the Earth was moving around the Sun every year, the constellations
          would have different shapes in different months of the year.</i
        >&quot; (That argument, known as the Parallax Problem, was used by
        Ptolemy to reject heliocentrism, and I think we can all see how it
        seemed compelling for two thousand years.) is a lot easier to understand
        than to understand (and to convince yourself they are true) the
        Aristarchus'es argument for the Sun being very far away and therefore
        much bigger than the Earth: &quot;<i
          >If the Sun and the Moon were approximately equally big and
          approximately equally far away, half-moon and the Sun would have to be
          close to each other. However, we see that, when the half-moon and the
          Sun are both visible up in the sky, the angle between them is almost
          90 degrees. The Sun has to be way further away from us than the Moon
          is. If the angle between the half-moon and the Sun is, let's say,
          87<sup>o</sup>, then the distance between the Earth and the Moon is
          only cos(87<sup>o</sup>)&#x2248;1/19 times the distance between the
          Earth and the Sun. But since they appear to be about the same size to
          us (solar eclipses may or may not be total), that means the Sun is
          that many times bigger. It has to be even bigger than the Earth.
          Saying the Sun moves around the Earth makes little sense in that
          light. It has to be the other way around.</i
        >&quot;. It is less surprising to me that Aristarchus was ridiculed in
        ancient times than that his ideas were finally accepted two thousand
        years later. Of course, it did not help that astronomy was, in ancient
        times, mostly done by people interested in mysticism (astrology and the
        like) rather than mathematics, but I do not think that was the primary
        reason. The primary reason is that our intuition fails us so badly when
        talking about astronomy.

          Anti-empiricism in pseudoscience - the fourth common error?
        </h3>
        Though somewhat rarer than those three types of errors in pseudoscience,
        another one which occurs again and again is making claims that, although
        they seem plausible on the face of them, they become ridiculous once you
        look at the data. An example is the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 is a
        biological weapon engineered to cause auto-immune disorders to render
        women infertile. Namely, those conspiracy theorists claim some T-shaped
        (spike protein) proteins which exist in the COVID-19 virus cause women'
        immune system to attack similar protein that exists in the uterus. They
        also claim COVID-19 vaccines containing that protein or containing mRNA
        coding for that protein make women infertile. At the beginning of the
        pandemic, that statement seemed somewhat plausible (at least to a
        layman, after all, we know white bread causes auto-immune reaction
        leading to type-1-diabetes in rats,
        <a
          href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-white-bread-does-not-cause-type-1-diabetes-in-humans-like-it-does-in-rats-and-that-the-correlation-is-not-low-only-because-everybody-eats-white-bread"
          >but presumably not in humans</a
        >, because their immune system is triggered by some deformed protein in
        bleached flour vaguely resembling some protein found in pancreas), but,
        more than a year into the pandemic... why is there no evidence of that?
        If that were true, don't you think there would be a ton of evidence of
        that, after countless women have survived COVID-19? Yet, conspiracy
        theorists continue claiming that, and are louder than ever, even though,
        when you look at the data now, that statement seems ridiculous. People
        who deny saturated fat causes heart disease similarly claim the tiny
        increase of HDL (high-density cholesterol) done by saturated fat offsets
        the huge increase in LDL (low-density cholesterol) they do. Which seems
        plausible until you look at the studies about the effect of HDL on heart
        disease. Most find only a small positive effect which is close to the
        margin of error, some find no effect whatsoever, and some even find a
        negative effect (usually concluding the effect of HDL on heart disease
        is in the form of a U-shaped curve, which is, again, dubious). When you
        look at the data about the effect of different types of cholesterol on
        heart disease, the suggestion that saturated fat might not cause heart
        disease seems ridiculous, does not it? People who advocate low-protein
        diets often say protein makes the calcium from our bones go to our
        kidneys and cause kidney stones. Which seems plausible until you look at
        the data showing protein does not even appear to cause osteoporosis, or,
        if it does, it has a miniscule impact compared to Vitamin K deficiency.
        At the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are arguing against
        vaccinating the young since their risk of dying from COVID-19 is
        miniscule, so the dangers of vaccine side effects may be greater,
        especially since young people have a stronger immune system and so
        supposedly having a higher likelihood of dying from a vaccine. Which
        sounds plausible on the face of it until you look at the data. In
        reality, all three people in the US for whom it is seriously suspected
        that vaccine side effects contributed to their death have something in
        common: all of them are 65 years old or older. Meanwhile, for thousands
        of people aged 20 to 30 around the world, who were fighting with deadly
        illnesses, COVID-19 was the drop that spilled the glass and killed them.
        Once you look at the data, the suggestion the COVID-19 vaccine is more
        dangerous for young than COVID-19 seems ridiculous, does not it? Claims
        that lockdowns and masks slow the pandemic down also do not appear to be
        supported by the data, but are at least not as blatantly contradicted by
        it. Another such example is the common claim, often made by
        anti-vegetarians, but also by some environmentalists, that methane in
        the atmosphere mostly comes from methane we use as natural gas. Just
        eye-balling the data makes it obvious that explanation is false. Methane
        emissions reached their peak somewhere in the 1980s, and reached record
        low in 2003, and is now only slightly above the 2003 levels. Clearly not
        correlated with the amount of methane we use: we are using more and more
        methane, mostly because we are switching from coal to natural gas as it
        is cleaner. The hypothesis that a significant percentage of our methane
        emissions come from grass-fed cows is at least not as blatantly
        contradicted by the data. I suppose people say stuff like that because
        human brain is wired to be against empiricism and to embrace the flawed
        philosophy of rationalism. Empiricism makes people humble, rationalism
        does not. Or maybe they are just being intellectually lazy and unwilling
        to look at the actual data.
        <h2 id="conspiracy_theories">Conspiracy theories</h2>
        The most common type of pseudoscience on the Internet are conspiracy
        theories. It's basically when you go to an Internet forum or a blog and
        start yelling: "Everyone is a liar. They are poisoning us! They are
        brainwashing us! The fuels of jet airplanes contain poisons! The Earth
        is flat! The Moon doesn't exist! Wake up, people!" Look, the largest
        conspiracy theory ever proven to be true was the Operation Snow White,
        involving, according to some sources, around 5000 people with a clear
        motive: to hide the illegal things their religious leader had done.
        Compare that to the popular conspiracy theories. If the Moon landing was
        faked, it would take hundreds of thousands of people to be in a
        conspiracy. Namely, they left some
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment"
          >mirrors</a
        >
        on the Moon that are detectible by lasers and hundreds of thousands of
        people have detected them. As for the 9/11 conspiracy theories, look,
        there have been so many both governmental and non-governmental
        investigations of it, and it would certainly take at least thousands of
        people to be in a conspiracy. And if you look at the actual claims made
        by those conspiracy theorists, like the videos of the crash being
        obviously fake, it would take millions of people to be in a conspiracy.
        The claims such as those that the Croatian general Mile Dedakovi&#263;
        made the Vukovar Hospital Massacre happen by colluding with &#381;eljko
        Ra&#382;natovi&#263; and secretly giving the weapons the president
        Franjo Tu&#273;man sent him during the Battle of Vukovar to some Serbian
        paramilitary are about as absurd, but you need to have some
        <i>specialized</i> knowledge to realize why.
        <h3 id="what_we_sound_like_to_conspiracy_theorists">
          What normal thinking sounds like to conspiracy theorists
        </h3>
        Conspiracy theories put people in some imaginary world in which, well,
        science is some force of evil, nothing can be learned and nothing makes
        sense (Almost a definition of a conspiracy theory is the denial of the
        simple truth that a single whistle-blower would be enough for a large
        plot to fall apart.). And in which mainstream thought seems like either
        laziness or even as an attack on the conspiracy theorists (For example,
        when Caesar said he would like to hear the other side of the story of
        the Catiline conspiracy, Cicero, and many others, accused him of being a
        part of the conspiracy). That's why it's so hard to fight them.
        Sometimes normal reasoning sounds even like insanity to conspiracy
        theorists. For example, anti-vaxxers sometimes say people advocating
        universal vaccination sound like gun advocates advocating for everyone
        being armed to achieve <i>herd immunity from crime</i>. That comparison
        is incredibly detached from reality (almost no social scientist thinks
        guns prevent crime, but almost all medical scientists think benefits of
        vaccinations significantly outweigh the risks), but those are conspiracy
        theories.
        <h3 id="when_conspiracy_theory_is_a_misnomer">
          When &quot;<i>conspiracy theory</i>&quot; is a misnomer
        </h3>
        Just before discrediting someone as a conspiracy theorist, make sure he
        really is one. For example, those who are skeptical of the policies made
        to address global warming are often grouped together with the global
        warming deniers, even though equating the two doesn't make any sense.
        <h3
          id="why_conspiracy_theories_are_not_the_most_dangerous_pseudoscientists"
        >
          Why conspiracy theorists are not the most dangerous pseudoscientists
        </h3>
        I think the most dangerous pseudoscientists are not conspiracy
        theorists, who by definition know the science is not on their side, but
        people who have convinced themselves and others that the science is on
        their side. You know, like those who think global warming proves
        government stealing money is somehow good for the environment, or the
        people who supported Lysenkoism. They tend to be way more persuasive and
        it is usually harder to convince them they are wrong. Global warming
        deniers usually say it is probably a good thing if the Earth gets
        slightly warmer, because deaths from cold weather are more common than
        deaths from warm weather. It is absurd to say that, because it is
        dangerous to try to make the nature we do not understand accomodate to
        us rather than to try to minimize our impact on nature. When trying to
        make nature accomodate to us, we are more-or-less in the position of
        ancient doctors, trying to solve problems we do not understand with
        cures we do not understand how they work, and we are more likely to hurt
        rather than to help. However, like Michael Huemer said, the same is even
        more true for government policies trying to solve the society's
        problems, because we understand even less about how society works than
        we understand about how nature works. Government policies to address
        climate change can easily end up being counter-productive because they
        have the opposite effect on the messy human beings than what was
        intended. Think about it this way, government policies seem to have no
        effect whatsoever on anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. CO<sub
          >2</sub
        >
        emissions continue rising in spite of all those international agreements
        about reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (but they are probably damaging
        to the economy). What does have a small effect are events that bring the
        economy to its knees. The 2008 Stock Market Crash (presumably caused by
        the tsunami in Japan) and the COVID-19 pandemic both decreased the
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by around 10%, and both were events that pushed
        hundreds of millions of people into poverty. There seems to be no
        particular reason for optimism, does it?
        <h3 id="how_to_fight_conspiracy_theorists">
          How to fight conspiracy theories
        </h3>
        On the left, I've linked to a parody of the conspiracy theorists where I
        show how easy it is to find pseudoscientific and pseudophilosophical
        arguments for any position you can think of, no matter how absurd. That
        might <i>wake up</i> some conspiracy theorists. I think that, if you
        want to convince some hard-code conspiracy theorist that he or she is
        wrong, you should tell them something like this:
        <i>
          Look, I know you can imagine yourself lying or keeping some secret.
          You probably think that, if you do that, the odds of you making a
          critical mistake or just feeling guilty enough to blow the whistle are
          very small. And they are. But you need to understand it is not the
          same thing as the conspiracy theory you are proposing. Once the
          conspiracy grows to thousands of people, it is bound to happen it will
          happen to include some person who will be a whistle-blower and provide
          smoking gun evidence of the conspiracy. Especially if it lasts for
          years, as people change their minds over the years. And especially in
          the modern day of the Internet, when it is trivial for whistle-blowers
          to provide smoking-gun evidence. </i

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        I hope I've helped some people deal with pseudosciences on the Internet,
        not spending substantial amounts of time researching some field before
        realizing it's pseudoscience, what has happened to me many times.

        UPDATE on 22/09/2019: I've just posted a YouTube
        <a href="https://youtu.be/ES5hAc2fLWU">video</a> about pseudoscience in
        American politics. If you can't open it, you can perhaps try to open a
        low-quality MP4 <a href="At_AOC-minified.mp4">file</a> hosted on this
        server (it can be opened on almost any platform using VLC Media Player).
        Failing to do even that, you can probably download the MP3
        <a href="At_AOC.mp3">audio</a>.<br /><br />
        UPDATE on 08/03/2020: I've just posted a YouTube video criticising
        climate change denialism, you can see it
        <a href="https://youtu.be/b6HFz5fXEqA">here</a>. If you can't open it,
        try <a href="TonyHeller.mp4">this</a>.<br />
        <br />UPDATE on 19/04/2020: <a href="AvioniNePostoje.pdf">Here</a> is
        the Croatian version of my parody of the conspiracy theorists. If you
        can't open it, try the <a href="AvioniNePostoje.doc">DOC</a>,
        <a href="AvioniNePostoje.docx">DOCX</a> and
        <a href="AvioniNePostoje.odt">ODT</a>.<br /><br />
        UPDATE on 07/04/2022: I have made a video debunking Tony Heller's claims
        about the election fraud. However, YouTube refuses to let me upload it
        there, so I have
        <a href="software-glitches.mp4">uploaded it on GitHub Pages</a>. My best
        guess as to why it cannot be uploaded is that YouTube's Artificial
        Intelligence thinks I am claiming the election fraud. Nothing could be
        further from the truth, I am critical of claiming such a thing. But
        that's how censorship using artificial intelligence works.<br /><br />
        UPDATE on 01/12/2023: A blogger called dr. Moran has made a video
        claiming that Moderna vaccination somehow magically (he doesn't even
        provide a speculative explanation of how it could) causes myocarditis in
        3% of vaccinated adolescents (that is, around 20 to 50 times more often
        than COVID-19 does). I made
        <a href="https://youtu.be/_fyTSDZEUbQ">a video response to that video</a
        >. In case you cannot open it, try downloading
        <a href="anti-vaxxers.mp4">this MP4</a> and opening it in VLC or some
        similar program. In all seriousness, though, making response videos to
        such claims is probably a waste of time. I think that Flat-Earthism has
        more chance of catching on that that does.
