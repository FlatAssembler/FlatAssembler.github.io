        <br />The pseudoscience that had the most dangerous results were
        probably the Trofim Lysenko's agricultural recommendations. They played
        a major role in the Great Chinese Famine of the late 1950s and early
        1960s. Anti-nuclear movement and global warming denial are similar in
        their logic to Lysenkoism (trying to make nature we do not understand
        accomodate to us instead of trying to minimize our impact on nature),
        and can easily end up being about as dangerous, if not even more.<br />

        Pseudoscience simply means "false science", something which is presented
        as science, but demonstrably doesn't follow the methods of science. Many
        people believe that pseudoscience is basically isolated to specific and
        widely discredited fields, like astrology and numerology. However, I
        would argue that pseudoscience is probably everywhere,

        at least wherever there are some people fighting for the truth (because
        at least some of them will be too ignorant for that).
        <br />To understand why, consider the case of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIgen">SCIgen</a>. It's a
        computer program that generates nonsense in the form of texts about
        informatics, using the vocabulary typical for them. Those texts were
        sent to a few well-known peer-reviewed journals. Most of them rejected
        them, yet some of them accepted them. When asked why, one of the
        recensents responded that it didn't make sense to him either, but he
        attributed its apparent incoherence to his own lack of knowledge in that
        particular field of informatics (<a
          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler/tree/master/seminar"
          >Here</a
        >
        is a paper I've recently written about informatics, I can understand how
        somebody might have a hard time differentiating stuff like that from
        gibberish.).<br />Pseudosciences are widespread because of the way
        people react to nonsense: they ascribe the apparent incoherence to their
        own lack of knowledge. And more intelligent you are, more likely you are
        to fall into that trap, because, more intelligent somebody is, easier it
        is for him to imagine that there is something he is unaware of, so that
        something that doesn't make sense to him actually does make sense. This
        type of thinking is as flawed as it can get, but it's very common (and
        perhaps mostly subconscious). In fact, I would argue there are reasons
        why intelligent but ignorant people are sometimes more likely to believe
        pseudoscience than actual science. First, pseudoscientists usually have
        more exciting ideas than actual science does. For example,
        pseudoscientists often claim to have discovered a method to reliably
        tell if somebody is lying to you. Those things interest people.
        Psychologists arguing such methods can't work much better than chance?
        Not so much. Pseudoscientists often claim they've reconstructed the
        first human language. Many people find that exciting. They will rather
        read that than read the linguists explaining their methods are contrary
        to the methods accepted in linguistics. Second, pseudoscientists usually
        have shorter rhetorics than the actual science does. For example,
        pseudoscientists often say things such as that the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"
          >double-slit experiment</a
        >
        proves that
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilocation">bilocation</a> is
        possible or that the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement"
          >quantum entanglement</a
        >
        explains the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a>.
        Now, if people actually read both sides of the story, that is, both what
        the pseudoscientists write and the actual science of the double-slits
        experiment and quantum entanglement, they would ask what drugs those
        pseudoscientists are on. But most of the people don't do that. They
        think that if someone has a short rhetoric regarding something, he knows
        what he is talking about. Third, though I am not sure if that plays a
        significant role, sometimes what makes sense to a scientist is different
        from what makes sense to a layman. To understand why, consider the
        following statements:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The ice will melt sooner on a piece of wood than on a piece of metal
            of the same temperature, because the metal feels colder when you
            touch it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The horizon appears to rise with you as you climb, and, if the Earth
            were round, we would expect it to fall. Therefore, the Earth is
            flat.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the Croatian village V&#238;ljevo (pronounced
            <i>VEEL-yev-aw</i>) obviously comes from the Latin word
            <i>v&#299;lla</i> (country house), both the consonants and the
            vowels and the accent match.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Those statements are false and probably incoherent with what the layman
        already knows. The metal of the same temperature will cause the ice to
        melt faster than the wood will for the exactly same reason it feels
        colder when we touch it. The metal at a room temperature is
        significantly colder than our body is, and, when we touch it, it takes a
        lot of heat from our body. A piece of wood, being the same temperature,
        takes less heat because it's a much poorer heat conductor. A better heat
        conductor will, of course, melt the ice faster. The second statement is
        false, because, well, the basic trigonometry. First of all, if the Earth
        were flat, I hope you agree, there would be no horizon in the first
        place for us to make this observation. Therefore, simply yelling that
        the Earth is flat isn't an explanation at all. Of course, those who
        claim the Earth is flat will claim there is some basically undetectable
        (for whatever reason) curving of light upwards, and that also can't be
        considered an explanation.

          >
        </div>
        Second, if you draw a diagram, you will see that the angle at which you
        see the horizon is given by the formula (assuming the Earth is a perfect
        sphere, which it actually isn't, but that's not so important here)
        <img
          src="formula.png"
          alt="angle=90-arcsin(r/(r+h))"
          style="display: inline; vertical-align: middle"
        />, where <i>r</i> is the radius of the Earth (around 6'000'000 meters)
        and <i>h</i> is your height relative to the surface of the Earth. So, if
        you are on the Mount Everest (9'000 meters height), you will see the
        horizon at the angle of 3.14 degrees. Barely perceptible. Actually, it's
        not even barely perceptible, because, when you are on the Mount Everest,
        the mountains hide the horizon in the first place. The third statement
        is wrong, because, well, the word <i>*v&#299;lla</i> (with a long 'i'),
        borrowed into Old Croatian, would give something like
        <i>*Ba&#783;o</i> (with a short falling tone on 'a') in Modern Croatian.
        Even if a linguist doesn't know the sound changes that happened between
        Old Croatian and Modern Croatian, he still wouldn't have expected the
        word to remain unchanged for more than a thousand years. The consonants,
        the vowels and the accent "matching perfectly" (ignoring the sound
        changes that have occured) is a strong (though not a necessary) argument
        for the words being unrelated, rather than related, because the sound
        changes don't affect individual words, but whole languages. A failure of
        a sound change to affect a word it could have affected is what requires
        an explanation, and not the word changing to the unrecognizability due
        to the regular sound changes. The point is, it's very easy for a layman
        to convince himself those statements (and the similar ones) make sense,
        sometimes even easier than it is to understand the true science to the
        point when it actually makes sense. Our senses are unreliable. We
        witness illusions and hallucinations (at least the ones such as dreams)
        all the time. Even when they do give us correct information, it's very
        easy to misinterpret. The science seeks to correct those things.
        Pseudoscientists sometimes appear to exploit those things to make people
        believe absurdities.<br />
        So, what do I think, what's a good way of recognizing pseudosciences?
        Well, let me be clear: the knowledge we are taught at school helps very
        little, if at all. We usually aren't taught how scientists know what
        they know, and that, during the history of science, most of the supposed
        discoveries were actually false.<br />
        In school, what we are taught about history of science are, at least the
        vast majority of them, the succes stories. That's not what's going on in
        the real world, for every discovery in some field, there were countless
        people who put a lot of effort and were confident they were right, but
        they got things wildly wrong. Because such things are only rarely
        mentioned in school, schools make us very susceptible to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"
          >survivorship bias</a
        >, making us think that, if somebody claims to have discovered something
        new, they likely have. The truth is, somebody who claims to have
        deciphered some ancient language is more likely to be somebody like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Goropius_Becanus"
          >Johannes Goropius Becanus</a
        >, a man who convinced himself and many others that the Egyptian
        hieroglyphs represent the Dutch language (seriously!), than like
        Champollion. If most of the experts in the field think you are wrong,
        and that's whenever you think you've discovered something new, you
        usually are wrong.<br />
        What we are taught at school might even have a detrimental effect to our
        ability to detect pseudoscience not only because they make us more
        susceptible to the survivorship bias, but also because schools often
        make us think we have competences we don't. The schools make us think we
        know how science works, but we are, thanks to the schools, not only
        ignorant, but also have a wrong conception about it. We are, for
        example, being taught linguistics and philology all the time in our
        Croatian language classes, and most of the people think that linguists
        and philologists are people who like to use some confusing arguments to
        discuss what is grammatical or stylistically right to say and what
        isn't. Nothing could be further from the truth, linguists and
        philologists are people whose job is to make testable theories about how
        languages work. But, if we think that linguists and philologists don't
        make testable theories, we see no reason to believe what they say about
        languages. And the same goes for most of the other sciences we are
        supposedly being taught at school. Some people advocate government
        policies like censorship to try to prevent pseudosciences from
        spreading. But, if you know anything about politics, you know that what
        politicians talk makes scientists dizzy. If the politicians were able to
        get rid of pseudosciences, they would first do that in politics. To the
        contrary, American politics is perhaps one of the main reasons the
        Internet is so full of pseudoscience. Namely, this isn't something
        people talk about a lot, but the American right-wing politicians (and
        sometimes also the left-wing politicians, but mostly the right-wing
        ones) hold a pressure on the media to support various conspiracy
        theories, because they are convinced that the science is some force of
        evil fighting against democracy and capitalism (and they are so
        fanatical that they do not see how absurd it is to do that if you
        actually care about democracy and capitalism). In the US, for example,
        it's completely normal to find an article in the newspapers claiming
        that the scientists are in a conspiracy hiding that evolution or
        anthropogenic global warming have been disproved. Why is it talked about
        so little? Well, partly because major social media platforms, such as
        YouTube, FaceBook and Twitter, routinely demonetize, remove from search
        results, or even ban those who are openly critical of the mainstream
        media (making it even harder to find out what the truth is). So, people
        are indoctrinated into that conspiracitory way of thinking, and apply it
        further. Everyone has to learn to recognize pseudoscience by themselves.
        What actually helps is knowing how people discover the pseudoscientific
        "knowledge".<br />They do what's called ad-hoc hypotheses. An excellent
        example of that is given by Carl Sagan. Suppose somebody claims they
        have a dragon in their garage. Of course, you don't believe them and ask
        them to show it to you. He says it's invisible. You ask him to spray
        some color on it to make it visible. He says that won't work because the
        dragon in his garage is incorporeal. So, you ask him to try to measure
        the temperature of the fire in its mouth. He says that won't work either
        and that the dragon's fire is heatless. I've studied many
        pseudosciences, and I can safely tell you, once you get deeper into some
        pseudoscience, that's the type of reasoning you engage in. You don't
        want to do an experiment because you know what the result would be.
        Scientists honestly try to falsify their hypotheses by experiments or
        observation. Pseudoscientists try to make up reasons why an experiment
        wouldn't work. You know, the horoscopes don't work because making one is
        error-prone. If you see such type of reasoning again and again in some
        field, you can be certain you are dealing with a pseudoscience.<br />Now,
        obviously, pseudoscientists are trying to hide that. They are making it
        look like their hypotheses aren't made up as excuses not to do an
        experiment, but that they actually logically follow from something.
        Biblical literalists claim their make-beliefs about the universe and
        atoms are based on the Bible. A little problem is: the Bible doesn't
        talk about those things. That's why the Biblical literalists can't agree
        on anything. They don't agree even whether the Earth is round of flat.
        Scientists, on the other hand, agree about those things. If people who
        study some field fail to agree on even the most basic things, you can be
        sure you are dealing with just another pseudoscience.<br />Now, the
        Internet culture gives us many clues how to recognize pseudoscience.
        Many of them will guide you right in the wrong direction. Many people,
        who want to hear both sides of some story, go to an Internet forum. The
        truth is, on Internet forums, you are happy to hear even one side of the
        story. If 100% of what's written by those who support pseudoscience is
        nonsense, and 90% of what's written by those who support science is
        nonsense, you are going to have a hard time trying to pick the right
        side. Many people say pseudoscience can be recognized by the authors
        expressing uncertainty. In fact, exactly the opposite is true.
        Pseudoscientists usually claim they are certain about what they claim,
        and scientists will often admit their uncertainty. The other thing we
        are often told is that pseudoscience can be recognized by searching for
        reliable sources. Well, let me say something heretical:<br /><b
          style="color: red"
          >Wikipedia is the most reliable source of information on the
          Internet!</b
        ><br />Wikipedia usually lets you hear both sides of the story about
        some issue and lets you make an informed oppinion. Other sources of
        information rarely do that. When Wikipedia is unreliable about
        something, then other tertiary sources of information (that is, those
        written by people who don't have very specialized knowledge of things
        they are writing about, such as encyclopedias or textbooks) are just as
        likely, if not even more likely, to be wrong about it. Common knowledge
        is not reliable source of information. There are many things that are
        believed by almost everybody, yet are false. For instance, almost
        everybody thinks that rabbits like to eat carrots, while carrots are
        actually quite
        <a
          href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/rabbits/diet/myths"
          >dangerous</a
        >
        for rabbits. Almost everybody thinks that mice like to eat cheese, when,
        in fact, cheese is
        <a href="http://animals.mom.me/can-pet-mice-eat-cheese-1370.html"
          >lethal</a
        >
        for mice even in relatively low amounts. It's hard to estimate how much
        of the common knowledge is actually false, but it could easily be most
        of it. And pseudoscientists use that to convince people. A good example
        of that could be the anti-nuclear movement using the well-known "fact"
        that Fukushima nuclear disaster killing many people by radiation. In
        reality, the number of people who have died because of the radiation is
        in the low tens, if not less than ten. The poorly organized evacuation
        is
        <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0936655516000054"
          >responsible</a
        >
        for far more deaths than radiation is. But who would have thought such a
        well-known thing from recent history is completely false? Similarly,
        people who advocate meat-based diets (and other low-carbohydrate diets)
        often appeal to the "fact" that Inuits have very low rates of
        atherosclerosis, when they, in reality, have higher rates of
        atherosclerosis than the USA average (and the USA has above
        world-average rates of atherosclerosis).<br />So, how do pseudosciences
        come to be? Well, people come to bad ideas in a similar way they come to
        good ideas. You know when Francis Crick got his idea about the structure
        of DNA while he was on drugs? Pseudoscientists are usually way more
        educated in some field than an average person is. Many of them are
        engineers or physicians (and those are people who seem to have tendency
        to think they are somehow qualified to talk about things they don't know
        much about, especially the scientific method). It's not important who
        says something or how he came to some idea, what's important is that
        they understand the scientific method and honestly try to follow it.
        Pseudoscientists don't follow the scientific method because they don't
        realize why it's important, and that it would eradicate the errors they
        make. The errors that seem to repeat from one pseudoscience to another
        appear to be ignorance of statistics, ignorance of psychophysics
        (perception) and misunderstandings of the epistemology.<br />You know
        when pseudoscientists try to establish a relationship between some two
        languages, find even less apparent cognates than what's expected to be
        found by chance, and then claim it can't be due to chance, usually
        without doing any math whatsoever? Or when creationists claim it's
        extremely unlikely for a simple cell to emerge from non-living matter,
        without having any idea how to actually calculate that? Or, perhaps the
        most famous such example, when global warming
        <a
          href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3624242/There-IS-a-problem-with-global-warming...-it-stopped-in-1998.html"
          >deniers</a
        >
        seem to think that any straight line drawn between two points on a graph
        is a trend-line? Or when anti-vaxxers claim that the studies that show
        that the number of vaccinated children who die in an outbreak of some
        disease outweighs the number of unvaccinated children who died somehow
        proves that vaccines don't work (despite of the number of vaccinated
        children being by order of magnitude greater than the number of
        unvaccinated children, and despite that nearly all unvaccinated children
        died, while only a small proportion of vaccinated children died)? A
        parody of that argument that kind-of gets to the point, but not quite,
        is &quot;<i
          >Most of the people who freeze to death are wearing a jacket,
          therefore, jacket does not help.</i
        >&quot;. Perhaps an even more appropriate analogy would be if a drunk
        driver caused a traffic accident in which many people died, and somebody
        argued &quot;<i
          >Well, most of the people who died in that traffic accident were not
          drunk, and that means the alcohol could not have caused it.</i
        >&quot;. I do not know about you, but I think it should be obvious that
        by compromising your immune system (for example, by refusing to get
        vaccinated) you are putting everybody at risk, and not just yourself.
        Apparently, it is not obvious to some people. Statin deniers often also
        make a similar argument &quot;<i
          >Most of the people who get heart attacks have normal cholesterol
          levels, therefore cholesterol does not cause heart disease.</i
        >&quot;, as if somebody claimed it was only the cholesterol that caused
        heart attacks (and not also high blood pressure...). During the COVID-19
        pandemic, anti-vaxxers have changed their strategy. The usual argument
        they use today, during the COVID-19 pandemic, is &quot;<i
          >Many more people died soon after taking the COVID-19 vaccine than
          after taking any other vaccine, therefore, COVID-19 vaccinations are
          unsafe.</i
        >&quot;. That argument is not even a misunderstanding of statistics, it,
        in my opinion, contradicts the very basic common sense, to the point
        that I ask myself whether people who are using that argument are being
        serious. COVID-19 vaccination was mostly given to elderly, unlike other
        vaccinations, which are mostly given to pre-school children. Of course
        elderly people are much more likely to die soon after taking a vaccine
        than children are, for reasons unrelated to the vaccine. Oddly enough,
        anti-vaxxers these days also seem to think that &quot;<i
          >The average age of death from COVID-19 is greater than life
          expectancy, therefore COVID-19 is not dangerous.</i
        >&quot; is a valid argument. That argument is also a misunderstanding of
        statistics, but of the let's-say-so-opposite kind: it ignores the fact
        that people who have already lived to the age of life expectancy of the
        country they are living in are likely to live for a few more years,
        rather than to die very soon. In ancient times, when life expectancy was
        around 35 years, that same argument would probably show cancer (and
        other diseases that affect many people today because we live long enough
        to get them, and young people do not tend to get them) is not dangerous.
        There is another family of arguments which boil down to misunderstanding
        of statistics in pseudosciences, and those are exampled by anti-vaxxers
        saying stuff like &quot;<i
          >Autism is rising around the world as the percentage of children who
          are vaccinated is rising, therefore vaccines cause autism.</i
        >&quot; or people who deny saturated fat causes heart disease pointing
        to the statistics supposedly showing saturated fat consumption in the
        USA peaked somewhere in the 1970s while deaths from heart disease are
        more common now than in the 1970s, or people who deny sugar causes
        type-2-diabetes pointing to statistics which supposedly show sugar
        consumption in the USA peaked somewhere in 1990s while type-2-diabetes
        is more common now. Those arguments, although they may seem convincing
        at first, are, in fact, very weak. They ignore huge other factors.
        Autism is more common in children whose mothers were old when they gave
        birth to them, and women today give births older and older. As for heart
        disease and type-2-diabetes, again, there is a huge other factor, and
        that is life expectancy rapidly increasing and more and more people
        living long enough to get those diseases. Furthermore, it is very
        questionable whether those statistics are accurate. Autism may simply
        appear to rise because more people have access to basic health care. And
        dairy consumption and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are
        hardly good proxies for saturated fat consumption and sugar
        consumption.<br />
        Or when the Flat-Earthers say things like that the fact that the horizon
        appears to rise as we climb proves that the Earth is flat? Or the
        conspiracy theorists claiming the photographic anomalies proving that
        the photographs are fake, even though they are exactly as some
        professional photographer would expect them to be? Or when the
        geocentrists claim that the sunrays not appearing to be parallel when
        the sun is in the zenith proves that the Sun isn't far away from the
        Earth? Those things are obvious examples of misunderstanding how our
        perception works, misunderstanding of psychophysics.<br />Or when
        pseudoscientists use the Occam's razor as a justification for the
        personal incredulity fallacy? That is a lack of understanding of
        epistemology.<br />I don't know about you, but I find the arguments
        based on perception most interesting. People uneducated about those
        things tend to have wild misconceptions about perception (like the
        emission theory of vision, see
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_theory_(vision)#Persistence_of_the_theory"
          >here</a
        >), yet they tend to be rather confident their understanding of the
        perception is close to right, and that they are able to evaluate the
        claims made by pseudoscientists.<br />
        The most common type of pseudoscience on the Internet are conspiracy
        theories. It's basically when you go to an Internet forum or a blog and
        start yelling: "Everyone is a liar. They are poisoning us! They are
        brainwashing us! The fuels of jet airplanes contain poisons! The Earth
        is flat! The Moon doesn't exist! Wake up, people!" Look, the largest
        conspiracy theory ever proven to be true was the Operation Snow White,
        involving, according to some sources, around 5000 people with a clear
        motive: to hide the illegal things their religious leader had done.
        Compare that to the popular conspiracy theories. If the Moon landing was
        faked, it would take hundreds of thousands of people to be in a
        conspiracy. Namely, they left some
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment"
          >mirrors</a
        >
        on the Moon that are detectible by lasers and hundreds of thousands of
        people have detected them. As for the 9/11 conspiracy theories, look,
        there have been so many both governmental and non-governmental
        investigations of it, and it would certainly take at least thousands of
        people to be in a conspiracy. And if you look at the actual claims made
        by those conspiracy theorists, like the videos of the crash being
        obviously fake, it would take millions of people to be in a conspiracy.
        The claims such as those that the Croatian general Mile Dedakovi&#263;
        made the Vukovar Hospital Massacre happen by colluding with &#381;eljko
        Ra&#382;natovi&#263; and secretly giving the weapons the president
        Franjo Tu&#273;man sent him during the Battle of Vukovar to some Serbian
        paramilitary are about as absurd, but you need to have some
        <i>specialized</i> knowledge to realize why. Conspiracy theories put
        people in some imaginary world in which, well, science is some force of
        evil, nothing can be learned and nothing makes sense (Almost a
        definition of a conspiracy theory is the denial of the simple truth that
        a single whistle-blower would be enough for a large plot to fall
        apart.). And in which mainstream thought seems like either laziness or
        even as an attack on the conspiracy theorists (For example, when Caesar
        said he would like to hear the other side of the story of the Catiline
        conspiracy, Cicero, and many others, accused him of being a part of the
        conspiracy). That's why it's so hard to fight them.<br />Just before
        discrediting someone as a conspiracy theorist, make sure he really is
        one. For example, those who are skeptical of the policies made to
        address global warming are often grouped together with the global
        warming deniers, even though equating the two doesn't make any sense. I
        think the most dangerous pseudoscientists are not conspiracy theorists,
        who by definition know the science is not on their side, but people who
        have convinced themselves and others that the science is on their side.
        You know, like those who think global warming proves government stealing
        money is somehow good for the environment, or the people who supported
        Lysenkoism. They tend to be way more persuasive and it is usually harder
        to convince them they are wrong.<br />On the left, I've linked to a
        parody of the conspiracy theorists where I show how easy it is to find
        pseudoscientific and pseudophilosophical arguments for any position you
        can think of, no matter how absurd. That might <i>wake up</i> some
        conspiracy theorists. I think that, if you want to convince some
        hard-code conspiracy theorist that he or she is wrong, you should tell
        them something like this:
        <i>
          Look, I know you can imagine yourself lying or keeping some secret.
          You probably think that, if you do that, the odds of you making a
          critical mistake or just feeling guilty enough to blow the whistle are
          very small. And they are. But you need to understand it is not the
          same thing as the conspiracy theory you are proposing. Once the
          conspiracy grows to thousands of people, it is bound to happen it will
          happen to include some person who will be a whistle-blower and provide
          smoking gun evidence of the conspiracy. Especially if it lasts for
          years, as people change their minds over the years. And especially in
          the modern day of the Internet, when it is trivial for whistle-blowers
          to provide smoking-gun evidence. </i
        ><br />I hope I've helped some people deal with pseudosciences on the
        Internet, not spending substantial amounts of time researching some
        field before realizing it's pseudoscience, what has happened to me many
        times. <br /><br />
        UPDATE on 22/09/2019: I've just posted a YouTube
        <a href="https://youtu.be/ES5hAc2fLWU">video</a> about pseudoscience in
        American politics. If you can't open it, you can perhaps try to open a
