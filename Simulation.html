        <br />The earliest proponent of digital physics is said to be
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a>, one
        of the greatest computer scientists of the first half of the 20th
        century.<br /><br />Its most vocal proponent today is without a doubt
        the British theoretical physicist called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram"
          >Stephen Wolfram</a
        >. Another honorable mention is perhaps the Dutch Nobel-prize-winning
        physicist called
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_%27t_Hooft#Fundamental_aspects_of_quantum_mechanics"
          >Gerard 't Hooft</a
        >. Gerard 't Hooft thinks the universe is a type of computer called
        cellular automaton, while Wolfram and I think that makes quantum
        mechanics unnecessarily difficult to explain.<br /><br />Popular
        physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson once said he would assign 50% probability
        that we are living in a computer simulation, implying he thinks Digital
        Physics (which has to be true if we are living in a computer simulation)
        is probably true.<br />

        UPDATE on 09/01/2022: By far the most common argument against atheism,
        at least by Christians, is the so-called Pascal's Wager. It's a
        statement that atheism is risky because it is insulting to God if God
        happens to exist, and we cannot be certain that God does not exist, so
        we should supposedly be on the safe side. I think that one of the best
        responses is this: What makes you think Christianity is the safe side?
        If God happens to indeed exist, he is very unlikely to be the Christian
        God (considering how many religions there are out there). So, what is a
        greater insult, saying to God &quot;<i
          >Sorry, I did not know you exist. I only heard a bunch of nonsensical
          stories about you, so I assumed you were made up just like those
          stories obviously were.</i
        >&quot; or &quot;<i
          >I am sorry, I seriously thought you were a psychopath who got angry
          at humanity and had to sacrifice your own son so that you could
          forgive us.</i
        >&quot;?<br /><br />
        Digital physics is a metaphysical statement that the fundamental laws of
        nature are such that they are able to be simulated by a computer. The
        science is still far from discovering the fundamental laws of nature, so
        such statements still belong to metaphysics (<a
          href="javascript::showDetails()"
          onClick="showDetails()"
          >show/hide details</a
        >).
        <p id="detalji" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px" hidden>
          It's sometimes stated that digital physics is being proven wrong, or
          at least made unlikely, by the modern discoveries in the field of
          quantum physics. Namely, the recently discovered laws of physics often
          describe the world in terms of probabilities. Sometimes those
          probabilities behave in a way different from what we are used to
          outside of the world of atoms, electrons and photons. Single electron
          particles, for example, when set to go through a board with
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"
            >two slits</a
          >, hit the florescent wall behind it generating the same probability
          distribution as wave interferences do. And the direction of their spin
          appears to be
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem#Overview"
            >affected</a
          >
          by the previously measured spin of an electron that's in the same
          plane but can be very far away. But here is a thing: if you make
          enough assumptions about those particles, you can actually explain
          away their behaviour using the laws of physics we are familiar with
          from everyday life. There have been some attempts to do so, the most
          notable being the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie–Bohm_theory"
            >pilot-wave theory</a
          >. They aren't accepted not because they give incorrect predictions,
          but because they supposedly aren't the simplest explanation. So, the
          exact laws that govern the way subatomic particles move are not
          metaphysically meaningful. Now, somebody might argue that metaphysics
          (a discipline where philosophy and physics meet) has a horrible track
          record, and I'd mostly agree with that, but I think you can say that
          digital physics is some sort of rejection of metaphysics, so that the
          bad track record of metaphysics does not make it less probable.

        Digital physics is not widely accepted, and the main reason for that is
        probably that it's not being communicated in a good way. Digital physics
        is often described, even by its proponents, as the theory that the world
        could be a computer simulation. That's quite a bit misleading. Digital
        physics doesn't suppose it's likely that our universe is simulated by
        some giant computer in some alien civilization, it simply supposes that
        the fundamental laws of nature are such that they could, in principle,
        be simulated by an enough-powerful computer. A perhaps better summary
        would be that the universe itself is a giant computer (not a "computer
        simulation").<br />So, here are some of its implications:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The material world doesn't exist. Every being in the world is made
            only of information that's manageable by a computer, that is, ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are no miracles. Every event that happens in the world has to
            be explicable using those fundamental and computable natural laws.
          </li>
          <li>
            God doesn't, and can't, exist. The same goes for the afterlife.
          </li>
          <li>
            Free will is entirely explicable using the
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory"
              >computational complexity</a
            >. Every system with enough computational complexity can be said to
            have free will. And since free will is so-to-say an illusion, laws
            make little sense, and punishing people who break the law with
            prisons makes even less sense. Which is one reason why I am a
            libertarian.
          </li>
          <li>
            Space and time themselves are made of pixels, small pieces of
            information. Each pixel is connected to a relatively small number of
            other pixels by an
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list"
              >adjacency list</a
            >. A change (movement) in one of these pixels can be caused only by
            the state of the pixels it's connected to. If you know the state of
            the pixels it's connected to, you can calculate its state. Now, it
            is hard to tell how the universe tells which pixel is connected to
            which pixel. The world is almost certainly not a Cellular Automaton,
            so that there is locality (that each pixel is connected only to its
            adjacent pixels), as that makes Quantum Entanglement hard to
            explain.
          </li>
        </ol>
        I realize that most of the implications I've listed seem absurd to most
        of the people today. But it's actually very easy to argue for them.
        Space and time being made of pixels appears to efficiently solve the
        Zeno's paradox of the Achiles and Tortoise.

        </div>
        It goes like this:
        <i
          >Consider a race of fast Achilles and a slow turtle. At the beginning
          of the race, the turtle is placed ahead of Achilles by 100m. Both of
          them start to run. Achilles reaches the place where the turtle used to
          be at the beginning of the race, however, the turtle has already moved
          a little. Achilles then runs to the place when the turtle was when he
          was 100m ahead of his start, however, the turtle has moved a bit more.
          And by the time Achilles reaches the place where the turtle is, the
          turtle will have moved even farther away. Therefore, Achilles can
          never overtake the turtle, only the distance between them decreases,
          but it never reaches zero. Now, obviously, Achilles will eventually
          overtake the Turtle.</i
        >
        It seems like the only sensible solution is that we assume that space
        and time are made of pixels, that the space is made of small cubes and
        that no particle can occupy only a part of such a cube, and that time is
        also not continuous. Then, the distance between Achilles and the turtle
        can't be between zero and the length of a pixel, but it goes immediately
        to zero when it comes the time when it should be smaller than a pixel,
        as it happens in computer games. I dare notice that Digital Physics is
        rather unique among metaphysical theories in that it at least attempts
        to address the Zeno's Paradox. Other metaphysical theories all seem to
        pretend that it's not an issue.<br />For most of the people today, the
        idea that the material world doesn't exist seems absurd. But, to
        paraphrase George Berkeley, we can only perceive ideas. When we say we
        see the Moon, we don't mean we perceive the Moon itself, we perceive
        only its appearance. And appearance is an idea. And the ideas can't be
        caused by material things, they share no properties of material things.
        Ideas can only be caused by other ideas. Therefore, the Moon can't be
        made only of material things, it has to be made of ideas. So, even if
        matter does exist, we have no way of perceiving it. It can't have an
        effect on anything we perceive, and it's therefore not a part of this
        world in any meaningful way. Another good argument against dualism
        (there being two types of substances, material and spiritual, and
        neither being reducible to the other one) I have heard is that, in order
        to suppose dualism is true, we would need to conceive a neuroscientist
        who says, with a straight face, "<i
          >We have applied the laws of physics and chemistry to neurons, and we
          got results which do not match the reality. Therefore, we need to take
          into account emotions and thoughts as well as the laws of nature, to
          correctly predict how neurons will behave.</i
        >". Of course, we can conceive anybody saying anything, but is it
        conceivable that there is a situation in which it is reasonable to say
        that? The Leibniz's Monadology, the claim that the material and the
        spiritual world do not actually react, but only appear to react, avoids
        that problem. However, I think that claim goes wildly against the
        Occam's Razor (Why not simply assume either material world or the
        spiritual world is an illusion?).<br /><span id="BibleNotEvidence"
          >Many people would say there is enough evidence of miracles supposedly
          happened in history, like the resurrection of the Christ. I think that
          they say that because they haven't tried to imagine the situation the
          New Testament describes. Imagine that someone you love is murdered.
          While you grieve, there comes some stranger and claims he is that
          person who rose from the dead. Would you believe him? Of course not!
          Then why do people think the apostles were right to do so? And that is
          assuming the events described by the New Testament actually happened.
          Why assume that? New Testament makes some very specific historic
          statements, which turn out to be false. For example, the Massacre of
          Innocents described in the Gospel of Matthew 2:16. No serious
          historian argues it really happened. You can perhaps dismiss the lack
          of evidence of Jesus himself existing as "<i
            >Well, Jesus was just some insignificant guy, the ancient historians
            did not write about such things.</i
          >", you cannot dismiss the Massacre of the Innocents the same way.
          Also, most Christians do not know that, but the Gospel of Matthew
          claims that <b>many</b> people were resurrected at that time, and not
          just Jesus (Matthew 27:53). While in that verse in the original and in
          the early translations
          <a
            href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/questions/15909/in-matthew-27-why-does-the-vulgate-call-the-graves-of-people-who-were-resurrect"
            >the wording seems somewhat weird, as an unusual word is used for
            <i>grave</i></a
          >, no scholar, as far I know, doubted that the intended meaning was
          that many people at the time rose from the dead and appeared to many
          people in Jerusalem. How is it possible something like that went
          unnoticed by non-Christian scholars at that time? Not to mention
          obvious nonsense such as the "<i
            >mountain so high all the kingdoms on Earth are visible from it</i
          >" from Luke 4:5 and Matthew 4:8 (implying the Earth is flat) and
          obvious contradictions between the Gospels (<i
            >Who discovered the empty tomb? Did angel Gabriel reveal himself to
            Joseph or to Mary?</i
          >...). So, even if we disregard the basic principle of history (that
          our understanding of history has to be in line with science), there
          still remains a strong case against the Bible being a reliable
          source.<br />
          Now, I know, many religious people believe that the apparent
          contradictions and nonsense in the Bible is a result of Bible being
          mistranslated, that the Bible even contains a lot of scientific
          knowledge, but that it has been lost in translation. Well, there are
          three problems with that claim:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Why would an omnipotent God let that happen? Why would he let his
              word end up being corrupt?
            </li>
            <li>
              If there really were scientific knowledge in the Bible, how is it
              possible that none of the ancient scholars, who knew the languages
              the Bible was written in far better than anybody does today,
              noticed that? Is not it kind of arrogant to claim that? Don't get
              me wrong, I understand the appeal of such theories, my
              <a href="toponyms"
                >alternative interpretation of the names of places in Croatia</a
              >
              is about of the same form (that names of places were explicable
              using languages that were spoken back then, but that all the
              scholars who were writing about those things failed to note that).
              But claiming that for the Bible, which literally hundreds of
              scholars in ancient times commented on, is just implausible.
            </li>
            <li>
              How do you know it is not the opposite of that? How do you know
              the meaning has been lost in translation, rather than a meaning
              being added to meaningless passages by translations? In Judith
              8:34 in Vulgate, which is quite a literal translation of the Greek
              original, it says &quot;<i>Et revertentes abierunt.</i>&quot;. Try
              to, without looking at modern translations, come up with a meaning
              which is both grammatically possible and logically possible. Can
              you? When I was reading the Bible in Latin, I was not able to.
              And, when I looked at modern translations, they seemed rather
              fanciful. I am no expert in Latin and Greek, but I think that
              passage would sound like an ungrammatical gibberish to native
              speakers of Latin and Greek.
            </li>
          </ul>
          I don't have all the time in the world to look into other supposed
          holy books, but I suspect them to be similar in that regard.</span

        Furthermore, as David Hume said, how come people to whom God reveals
        himself are almost always people for which we have a good reason to
        think they are insane? Saint Paul, who is basically a founder of
        Christianity (as Jesus Christ left nothing written), is generally agreed
        by scholars to have been a serial killer. Muhammad was, given what we
        know today, probably a pedophile. Why couldn't God at least pick a sane
        person to spread his word? I understand that, as Jesus said in Matthew
        9:12, "<i>It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</i>"
        (which is, I think, wrong, as many illnesses are easy to prevent while
        you are healthy if you know about them), but there is very little
        evidence of God healing anybody. And choosing a sane person to spread
        his word would be a good idea, wouldn't it?<br />We appear to be
        bombarded with the examples of miracles happening everywhere. However,
        we almost never have enough knowledge to evaluate those examples. And
        when we do, we end up with a conclusion that maybe it wasn't a miracle
        after all. Kind of similar to the stories of government policies
        helping, see my
        <a href="libertarianism.html">blog-post about libertarianism</a> for
        that. Sure, claiming that government can heal the ills of the society is
        far less absurd than the claim that actual miracles (defying the laws of
        natural sciences) happen, but it is of the same form. Fixing the
        society's ills, if possible at all, is only possible with knowledge of
        social sciences that nobody yet has. And governments are more-or-less in
        the position of medieval physicians, trying to solve problems they do
        not understand. Social sciences we have today are proto-science, and
        claim that governments have cured some societal illness is just as
        absurd as the claim that ancient physicians cured anybody. Yet,
        politicians bombard us with supposed examples of government policies
        curing the society, as if us not being to explain away every single one
        of those examples somehow proves governments are necessary, rather than
        about as harmful as ancient physicians were. In other words, they
        bombard us with controversial claims about their miraculous
        achievements. And the same goes for the claims that farming animals
        somehow improves the environment (as people who are against
        vegetarianism often claim). We do not understand much about how ecology
        works, and thinking we can improve it is absurd. Getting back to the
        topic, people in ancient times used to believe that everything was a
        miracle: earthquakes meant spirits were displeased and a flash from sky
        meant God was angry. Today, we laugh at those superstitions. Yet, many
        people use that same type of reasoning today. As if the opposite of
        &quot;<i>I can explain it.</i>&quot; is not &quot;<i
          >I cannot explain it.</i
        >&quot;, but, somehow, that it is &quot;<i>God did it!</i>&quot; (even
        when it does no apparent good, like earthquakes, or has obvious flaws,
        like human body has).<br />The simple truth is, if there was a good
        all-powerful God, there would be no evil in the world. But there
        obviously is. Religious people generally respond by saying that evil is
        necessary because of free will. But free will is not the only cause of
        evil in the world. How could free will be responsible for the
        earthquakes and the children being born ill? Furthermore, thanks to
        modern science, we know evil in the world long predates free will:
        animals capable of feeling pain existed for hundreds of millions of
        years before humans. And quite a few of them died very painful deaths.
        For example, rabbits that live longer than around 2 years (if something,
        such as an accident or a predator or some other illness, does not kill
        them before that), have more than 50% chance of getting ovarian or
        testicular cancer (sexual organs of many animals appear to be
        exceptionally poorly designed). So, unless you will hold animals
        responsible for their actions, you cannot claim all suffering in the
        world comes from free will. Not to mention, the existence of an
        omniscient God is probably philosophically incompatible with free will.
        Erasmus of Rotterdam needed to write whole books about the topic making
        ad-hoc hypotheses around that problem. So, saying "<i
          >God can exist in spite of evil in the world, because evil in the

        >" is literally as stupid as when the Flat-Earthers say ships disappear
        bottom first even when there are no waves. Obviously ships disappear
        bottom first even when there are no waves, and waves are not even an
        explanation for ships disappearing bottom first: as long as waves are
        below your eye level, they cannot cover anything above your eye level.
        Similarly, free will is obviously not the cause of all evil in the
        world, and it actually cannot even explain why evil would exist if there
        was an omniscient God. Many religious people, starting perhaps with the
        philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, say we are living in the best of all
        possible worlds, and all the evil is an illusion. But if that were true,
        engineering (improving the world by applying science) would be
        impossible, and it clearly is not.

          >Furthermore, it is clear an intelligent designer would do at least
          slightly better job designing a human being than the evolution did.
          The vast majority of birds and mammals can synthesize Vitamin C
          themselves and cannot get scurvy. Their liver produces Vitamin C.
          Human beings and monkeys have the genes for that, but they are
          corrupted into being useless. During history, a significant percentage
          of population died because of scurvy. Scurvy is still relatively
          common, and almost certainly under-diagnosed. This is not the best of
          all possible worlds, that much should have been obvious back at the
          time of Leibniz, and it should be even more obvious now.<br />
          The world is full of such things suggesting it wasn't intelligently
          designed. For example, human beings cannot detect a lack of oxygen in
          their blood, and can only detect high CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Which is
          usually a good proxy, but sometimes it is not. When we are on a high
          mountain, both CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen levels in our blood fall, but
          we do not feel the urge to breathe more deeply. That can be dangerous.
          Yet, there are some mammals relatively closely related to humans which
          can detect lack of oxygen in their blood, and respond appropriately.
          Similarly, monkey immune system can deal with HIV-like viruses well,
          whereas human immune system collapses because of them. If there was an
          intelligent designer who had human DNA, and DNA of other species, like
          programming code on their computer, solving those problems would be a
          simple copy-paste to them. Why did not they do that? An obvious
          explanation is that there was no such intelligent designer. And "<i
            >This is the best of all possible worlds.</i
          >" requires such a designer to be almighty. Once you assume that, the
          world makes even less sense. Why does our liver respond to fructose in
          diet as if we were starving, that is, producing VLDL (which is useful
          if there is not enough fat in the diet, but otherwise causes heart
          disease) and doing gluconeogenesis (as if there was not enough glucose
          in the diet)? There does not seem to be a simple solution? So what,
          when the designer of this world is supposed to be almighty? Why does
          our liver respond to saturated diet in our diet by massively raising
          the LDL cholesterol levels and slightly increasing HDL cholesterol
          levels, as well as becoming more insulin resistant? Our diet is not
          supposed to include a lot of saturated fat or fructose? Sorry, I am
          not buying that explanation, as our natural diet clearly included a
          significant portion of both. Regardless, why wouldn't an almighty
          designer make our bodies respond more appropriately? The way our
          bodies react to fructose and saturated fat make little sense even in
          the context of the evolution (though it can be rationalized by saying
          evolution did not care what would happen with a human body once a
          human lives over 40, since, in nature, very few people lived over 40),
          and much less so in the context of intelligent design. Why does our
          immune system respond to trans-fat in blood by causing heart attacks?
          An almighty creator did not think we will one day eat margarine,
          soybean oil and butter, unaware of the danger of trans-fat (worse yet,
          thinking they are healthy, back when we understood physiology enough
          to understand the dangers of saturated fat, but not enough to
          understand the dangers of trans-fat)? Well, you can
          <i>perhaps</i> explain away trans-fat being dangerous that way, but
          you cannot explain away the way our bodies react to fructose and
          saturated fat. And why does heme iron mixed with omega-6-acids cause
          colon cancer? Why did not the almighty creator fix it? There does not
          seem to be a simple solution, because we do not know exactly how heme
          iron causes colon cancer? Again, we are talking about an almighty and
          omniscient creator here. The creator did not want us to eat meat? Oh,
          and they couldn't think of a better solution? Furthermore, why do the
          laws of nature seem so hostile to life, especially intelligent life?
          Abiogenesis can only happen in an environment without oxygen (because
          oxygen destroys nearly all organic compounds), yet intelligent life
          can presumably only evolve in an environment in which oxygen can be
          used as a source of energy. The way laws of physics and chemistry are
          set in this universe, intelligent life evolving presumably requires a
          mass extinction caused by a massive increase in oxygen in the
          atmosphere, in which some Rhizobium-like bacteria (on which all modern
          life on Earth depends) accidentally survive, as has happened on Earth
          two times (massive increase of oxygen in the atmosphere followed by a
          mass extinction of nearly all life on Earth). On Earth, we survived
          all that. But the vast majority of universe is void of life. On most
          planets, abiogenesis did not happen at all. On most planets where it
          did happen, life is limited to underground bacteria (like presumably
          Mars) or bacteria floating up in the atmosphere (like perhaps Venus).
          Saying the nature was designed by an almighty creator with intelligent
          life like us in mind is, in the light of evidence we have, beyond
          absurd. Even saying the creator guided evolution or merely set up the
          laws of nature is absurd. Religious people will either pretend that it
          is not an issue with their religion, or arrogantly claim that the
          evidence has been misinterpreted. But why are we living in a universe
          in which evidence for the creation is so easily misinterpreted? It is
          true that nature is full of amazing good things which seem difficult
          to explain via evolution (eyes...), but that is not an argument for
          the existence of a creator unless you somehow discount all the amazing
          bad things in nature. HIV, for example. Its evolution seems rather
          puzzling, does not it? I mean, it is a virus that purposefully
          modifies your DNA to shut down your immune system. How could something
          like that even begin to evolve, when only 3% of human DNA is
          transcribed onto mRNA (and less than a third of that 3% is actually
          useful information about how different protein is synthesized), and
          thus a virus that tries to achieve something by randomly modifying
          your DNA has at least 97% chance of accomplishing absolutely nothing?
          Not only begin to evolve and co-evolve with some host, but also jump
          across species with different number of chromosomes, as it jumped onto
          humans from monkeys in wet markets? If we were to use the creationist
          logic that everything which is difficult to explain in terms of
          evolution (at least to a layman) needs to be done by God, then we are
          forced to conclude the obviously unacceptable notion that God created
          HIV.</span
        ><br />
        And belief in creationism is a fertile ground for all kinds of dangerous
        science denial. If we believe our bodies were intelligently designed,
        there is a reason to believe science is wrong about saturated fat
        causing heart disease, because why wouldn't the creator do anything
        about it? Or even that statins work, because why would a creator make
        our liver produce low-density cholesterol in response to saturated fat
        and fructose if it did not make sense? Namely, many people, many of whom
        are creationists, claim low-density cholesterol is our body's proper
        response to inflammation in the arteries and should not be countered by
        statins, in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. If you
        believe in non-guided evolution, there is no problem accepting those
        facts from nutritional science. If creationism is true, then nature
        knows best. If it is not, then discussions about what is natural and
        what is not are pointless. And any intelligent person would agree that
        they are pointless. And not too long ago, many people were denying high
        blood pressure (caused, for example, by salt) should be treated, with
        similar arguments. They claimed high blood pressure is a natural and
        good response of our body to our blood vessels getting too narrow, so
        that blood can be forced through those vessels in spite of them being
        too narrow. Creationism gives credibility to such claims. We need to
        stop giving credibility to such claims, as they significantly hinder the
        advancement of medicine and nutritional science.
        <br />
        Many people find the idea that there is no afterlife frightening. Well,
        I find the idea of there being one way more frightening. Think of it
        this way: you were dead for eternity before you were born. It's not that
        you suffered because of that, you just simply weren't there. And I find
        it comforting to think that everyone who claims there is something to be
        afraid of after you die is just sucking that out of his little finger.
        Afterlife, as is commonly imagined, appears to contradict the basics of
        quantum mechanics. Namely, most people imagine souls as something that
        can see but can in no way be detected. But quantum mechanics teaches us
        there is no such thing as a passive observer. Not to mention the
        philosophical problems with afterlife, namely, what makes you
        <i>you</i>. In what sense is a soul, which does not have any of your
        memories (which are demonstrably stored in your brain), <i>you</i>? What
        good is it if I am reunited with my dead grandmother in heaven if I will
        not be able to recognize her, nor will she be able to recognize me?<br />Atheism
        has a bad name, because some of the well-known atheists, like Karl Marx,
        just replaced God with another dogma, like communism. Socialism and
        communism don't logically follow from atheism in any way.
        <span id="TheocracyWorseThanCommunism"
          >Besides, how is theocracy, advocated by many religious people, any
          better than communism? Like Clive Staples Lewis (otherwise a devout
          Christian) explained: "<i
            >The nearer any government approaches to theocracy the worse it will
            be. Metaphysics held by rulers with force of religion is a bad sign.
            It forbids them, like the inquisitor, to admit any grain of truth or
            good in their opponents, it abrogates the ordinary rules of morality
            and it gives a seemingly high, super-personal sanction to all the
            very ordinary human passions by which, like other men, the rulers
            will frequently be actuated. In a word, it forbids wholesome doubt.
            A political program can never be more than probably right. We never
            know all the facts about the present and we can only guess the
            future. To attach to a party program, whose highest claim is to
            reasonable prudence, the sort of assent which we should reserve for
            demonstrable theorems, is a kind of intoxication.</i
          >". Communists at least realize their political program is made by a
          fallible human being, which is Karl Marx. They think it is based on
          science (it really is not, but that is irrelevant here), and they
          realise science is sometimes wrong. Theocrats think their political
          program is made by an infallible deity, and, as such, they are more
          immune to the evidence of their policies doing more harm than good.
          Theocracy is also far less sensible than communism. Theocracy assumes
          the spiritual world exists, that the spiritual beings communicate with
          humans, that the communication between some spiritual entity and the
          person who wrote their holy book did occur, that the being that
          communicated to us from that spiritual world is benevolent, and that
          they knows more about what is going on in our world than we ourselves
          do. Each of those assumptions is not based on solid evidence, and,
          taken together, the idea of theocracy is more ridiculous than the idea
          of communism.</span
        ><br />I hope I've communicated the ideas of digital physics in an
        understandable and thought-provoking way. I understand that, if you this
        is the first time you were exposed to the ideas of digital physics, you
        probably aren't convinced. In fact, you likely consider me crazy. It's
        OK, I just hope I've made you think so that you might change your mind.
        <br /><br />UPDATE on 03/06/2018: There are many examples of how
        physical phenomena, which are almost impossible to calculate by hand,
        can be simulated by a computer program of just a few lines of code. One
        of them I've made is the analog clock linked to the left (the pendular
        movement is extremely hard to calculate, yet it can be easily simulated
        by a computer). The other one might be the electric field
        <a href="electricity.html">simulator</a> I've made today. So, why
        couldn't the whole universe be just like that? <br /><br />UPDATE on
        29/07/2019: It's a common misconception that people educated in history
        and social sciences tend to believe in creationism, or at least strongly
        believe in God. That's just not true. I've opened a

        about religion on a Latin language forum, and what's obvious is that
        people there don't like talking about religion. In case that website
        goes down, here is the short essay I've written, feel free to copy from
        me:
        <span class="quotation" lang="la"
          >Quid homines in hac agora censent, num Deus realis sit? Ego censeo
          Deum non realem esse. Si Deus realis sit, quomodo possibile est ut tot
          differentes religiones in terra sint? Cur Deus permittat his
          religionibus exsistere, et ut tot homines audiant solummodo fabulas de
          Deis, quae non sunt veritas? Cur omnipotens et benevolens Deus
          permittat tot innocentibus hominibus in Tartarum ire falsae religionis
          causa?<br />
          Et Biblia dicit multas res, quas nunc scimus non veras esse. Jesus
          dixit eclipses lunae et solis signum Dei fuisse ("Sol convertetur in
          tenebras, et luna in sanguinem, antequam veniat dies Domini magnus et
          manifestus."). Nunc scimus, et multi philosophi eo tempore etiam
          sciebant, id non ita esse. Jesus praedicavit pauperes pauperiores
          futuros esse, et quod dives divitiores futuri sint ("Omni enim habenti
          dabitur, et abundabit, ei autem qui non habet, et quod videtur habere,
          auferetur ab eo."). Et hodie paene nemo est ita pauper, quomodo paene
          omnes homines eo tempore erant. Eo tempore paene omnes homines nudi
          erant, quia non poterant togas emere. Et Jesus etiam dixit bellum
          solutionem fuisse ("Nolite arbitrari quia pacem venerim mittere in
          terram, non veni pacem mittere, sed gladium."). Si Jesus in vicesimo
          saeculo esset, is cum socialistibus concordet. Jesu non fuit sapientia
          divina.<br />
          Et de theologia, ego diligo quod Richard Dawkins scripsit:
          <i
            >"Theologia numquam dixit aliquid, quod neque perspicuum fuisset
            (facile visu), neque falsum fuisset. Quando theologia dixit aliquid,
            quod alicui utile (quod aliquem adiuvat) est? Vera scientia curas
            morborum sciscit, theologia loquitur peccata morbos facere."</i

            Qualis res (realis) est?

          Difficile dictu est quid realitas sit. Sed si aliquid absurdum sit,
          possumus scire id non realis esse. Omnipotens et benevolens Deus, qui
          terraemotos permittat, absurdus est. Benevolens (non malus) Deus, qui
          faciat homines in Tartarum ire falsae religionis causa, absurdus est.
          Et omnipotentia (verbum de aliquo qui omnia possit) ipsa absurda est.
          Potestne omnipotens Deus petram ita gravis (non levis) facere, ut eam

          Quid homines in hac agora censent, num vita post mortem existat?
          Creditisne in paradisum, quo boni homines eunt cum morientur, et in
          flammam aeternam (Tartarus), ubi mali homines eunt cum morientur, vel
          in reincarnationem, et cetera? Ego censeo vitam post mortem non realem
          esse.<br />
          Multi homines huius temporis dicunt physica quantorum arguere pro vita
          post mortem. Sed ego censeo physica quantorum arguere contra vitam
          post mortem. Si non contra omnes formas vitae post mortem, tunc contra
          formam vitae post mortem in quam plurimi homines credunt. Plurimi
          homines imaginantur animas, et ut ea animas quodam modo possint
          videre, sed eae animae non possint videri ab aliquibus machinis. Sed
          physica quantorum docet nobis quod passivi observatores non dantur.
          Particulae electricitatis agunt ut undae cum non spectantur, sed eae
          agunt ut particulae cum spectantur. Si animae existunt quae possunt
          videre, eae animae possint videri ab aliquibus machinis. Ergo, forma
          vitae post mortem, in quam plurimi homines credunt, ea contradicit
          firmissimae scientiae, quae est physica quantorum.<br />
          Et ego censeo omnia forma vitae post mortem contradicunt scientiae de
          cerebro. Rogeris: Quid aliquod ens debet habere, ut illud ens tu ipse
          sit? Illud ens debet habere tuas memorias et tuas ideas, annon? Sed
          scimus eas res partes cerebri esse. Ergo, quomodo potest tua anima,
          pars tui quae supersit cum tu morieris, esse idem quod tu es? Si pars
          cerebri nocita est, homo non potest homines, quos scit, cognoscere.
          Non necessarium dictu, ea pars cerebri, quae homines cognoscit, finit
          operari tempore quo homo moritur. Quid bonum animae in paradiso esse
          sit, si ea anima non potest suos mortuos amicos cognoscere?<br />
          Et si homines habent animam qui tempus potest sentire, quomodo id est
          ut, cum homo evigilat ex coma ("somnium" in quo cerebrum agit nihil),
          is nescit quantum tempum ibat? Sane, aliqui homines qui in sine
          conscientia erant, dicunt se videre aliquid (lucem, cryptam,
          cuniculum...). Sed plurimi homines qui sine conscientia erant,
          memorantur nullas res ex eo tempore. Quomodo id possibile est, si
          homines habeant animas? Si homines habeant animas, homines qui sine
          conscientia sunt, sentiant longas (quia tempus ibat) silentes tenebras
          (quia partes cerebri, quae vident et audiunt, non operantur),
          annon?<br />
          Ego etiam censeo vitam post mortem contradicere theoriam evolutionis.
          Hodie nos scimus nostras mentes in gente esse cum mentes animalium.
          Ergo, ubi linea (limes) esset? Quae animalia habent animam, et quae
          animalia non habent animam? Spongiae animalia sunt quae non habent
          nervos. Ergo, habentne spongiae animas? Aliquae animalia, cindaria,
          exampli gratia, non habent cerebrum, sed habent nervos. An cindariae
          ergo habent animas? Et aliquae animalia plus intellegentia sunt ab
          aliquibus hominibus. Aliquae simiae plus intellegentes sunt ab
          aliquibus hominibus, qui cum debili cerebro nati sunt. An simiae ergo
          habent animas?<br />
          Multi homines censent iustitiam esse, quod vita post mortem (paradisum
          et flamma aeterna) existat. Sed omnia mala quae in hoc mundo possumus
          agere finita (non infinita) sunt, et poena flammae aeternae (Tartarus)
          infinita est. Ergo, poena flammae aeternae numquam potest iustitia
          esse. Reincarnatio etiam iustitia non est. Quomodo potest iustitia
          esse, aliquem punire si is non scit cur is punitur?<br />
          Multi homines dicunt se timere non existendi post mortem, quia non
          existere aliquid horribile sit. Sed omnes eramus mortui infinito
          tempore antequam nati sumus, et non patiebamur eius causa. Mors
          abstrahit omnia placita ex nostris vitis, sed ea etiam abstrahit omnes
          dolores ex nostris vitis. Cum mortui erimus, non sentiemus quo tempus
          ibit. Non videbimus aeternas tenebras. Mortuo homini tempus finit,
          tempus non ibit ei. Sicut Epicurus dixit: Cum ego sum, mors non est,
          et cum mors erit, ego non ero.

        to my video about afterlife. I have decided to copy it here, in case
        somebody is interested and has not joined his Discord server:
        <div class="quotation" id="AndreasAlcor">
          Cum pellicula tua ("electronicum uisum", secundum te) latine sit
          bonaque, ut dixisti, puncta tibi mortua lingua locuto dederis, nos
          inuicem latine respondebimus, nec breuius nec perquam copiose. Ante
          dicendum est me nec philosophum esse nec physicum, nec philosophiam
          atque scientiam physicam adeo curare ut de his opera legere contendam,
          nisi delectationis gratia. Non igitur omnino consulto argumenta mea
          proposuero; confutationi nihilominus commoda prorsus inuenies.
          <br />
          Dicam insuper non solum latine, sed omnibus linguis, sermonibus,
          loquelisque dubitandum esse quin bene inter nos intellegamus. Si quid
          igitur perperam intelleximus, certiores ut nos facias iam nunc
          praerogamus, sed item praerogamus te ut nos interroges si quid minus
          intellexeris antequam refutes.<br />

          Imprimis Deum deesse uolueris probare et ut hoc confirmares
          necessarium censebas animi aut animae immortalitatem falsam esse. Hoc
          ut efficeres tria protulisti cur Deus Christianorum mala fieri
          permitteret argumenta, et paucis ea reprehendisti. Sed hoc iam ab
          incepto minus prudenter facere uideris: sententiae 'malum necessario
          uoluntatem (scilicet libertatem sponte faciendi) nostram consequitur'
          uiri, ut dicimus, coronarii quinquagiens centena milia hominum
          necantis mentionem faciendo respondes, quasi hoc uirus si numquam
          adueniret uoluntas uespertiliones edendi aliquo modo retineretur, ut
          argumentum irrideas. At hoc, quamquam tibi assentior malum non
          necessario uoluntatem consequi, haud quicquam redarguit, quod ne
          intellexisse quidem uideris sententiam. Fieri potest ut hoc iam
          diutius animo uolutaris atque hoc irrisu tuo "ne multa" dixeris, tamen
          hoc ipsa in pellicula non est manifestum.
          <br />
          Deus enim Christianorum arborem uel, ut in Vulgatis scriptum est,
          lignum posuit in medio Paradiso, uetuitque Adam uxoremque de fructu
          eius comesse, sed de hoc ne multa dicam quod omnes fere nos europaei
          hanc fabulam bene nouimus. Libera uoluntas donata dici potest (utrum
          assentiamur annon alia disputatio est) ideo quod serpens Heuae de hoc
          fructu esse persuasit atque Heua, sponte sua, contra numen Dei,
          fructum sibi carpsit. Si, Teo, rem recordaris, hoc scientiae boni et
          mali (Genesis 2.9) fuit lignum, inde Adam atque Heua se nudos
          colligentes erubuere, inde sciunt, secundum Vulgata, homines bonum
          atque malum esse, inde consequitur malum uoluntatem. Vtrum necessario
          consequatur necne disputari possit sed alias.
          <br />
          Vtrum haec sententia ad rem nostram, cur Deus mala fieri permittat,
          pertineat necne etiam disputari possit, tamen nequaquam redigitur ad
          uirus coronarium atque ad homines hoc morbo mortuos.
          <br />
          Deinde adesse dicis tales christianos quales nos in mundo quam potest
          optimo uiuere dicant. Haec ad rem ne pertinet quidem quia si hoc in
          mundo, quem optimum profitemur, nefas malum nihilominus adest, cur
          adest? Nonne Deus omnipotens hoc auertere possit? Et iam reducimur ad
          primam questionem, ergo haec secunda opinio nullius momenti habeatur.
          His quamuis dictis attamen dicendum est te hanc sententiam alio
          duxisse et Deum hoc malum uirus nobis eo immisisse ut aliquid maius
          periculum auerteretur, quod sententia ipsa numquam exposuit. Hoc etiam
          irrisui tuo ascribo.
          <br />
          Tum consilium tertium hypotheticum accipis quod solum si aliquid post
          mortem habetur probari potest; de morte quidem et imprimis quid post
          eam fiat meditari oportet, caute autem et cogitate, ne in mendacia aut
          in ineptias incidamus. Haec quae adhuc fecisti bono animo ludibrio tuo
          neque insipientiae adiudico.
          <br />
          Iam ea quae tu argumenta uoces tangimus. Primum eorum animam omnino
          deesse narrat, in quam homines, ut ais, credere solent. Primum
          dicendum est fieri non posse ut anima omnino desit, alioqui mortuus
          sis. 'Soul' anglice scripsisti, quod hanc ambiguitatem procul euitat,
          tamen, cum latine nunc loquamur et ut melius inter nos intellegamus,
          enodandum censeo id quod inter animam et animum differt. Animam ut
          uiuamus ducimus, animam ducere spirare est. Eo ita dicimus quia anima
          uis uitalis est qua uigemus, quae nobis mortuis etiam diffugit. Animus
          uero aliquid corporis expers atque morale in hominibus principium est,
          qui immortalis, ut habetur, numquam uanescit. Sic anima physiologica,
          animus psychologica uis. Pulchre enim narrat Iuuenalis in Satura sua:
          <br />
          <i
            >Mundi / principio indulsit communis conditor illis / tantum animas,
            nobis animum quoque [...]</i
          >
          (Iuv. 5.15 uers. 147-149)
          <br />
          Ceterum has res circa nos adesse arbitratus es, quae uidere possunt
          sed uideri nequeunt, sed numquam mehercules quemquam siue animos siue
          animas circum nos quasi satellites circumuolitare dixisse audiui nisi
          scientologos qui, ut ipsi aiunt, thetan operatiuum, his enim uerbis
          significant eos qui iam liberi ab omnibus doloribus sapiunt, eos solum
          dicant animum et animam suam emittere posse. At animus uulgo in homine
          inesse solet.
          <br />
          Vtrum uideri possit etiam disputatum est nam ut etiam Quintilianus
          "oculi," inquit, "per quos maxime animus emanat", sic dici possit
          animum animo sensum esse. Alii magis sentiunt, alii quaesi caeci nihil
          percipiunt, sed cum colores caecis explanari nequeant, peto et
          contendo quonam modo psychophatico animi motuum consensionem
          illustres? Nec uolo nunc utrum animus uere adsit an absit approbare,
          at quod attulisti argumentum, cum nec quid animus sit definiris—atque
          quae de eo dixisti, non inepte dico, admodum insolita habentur—nec
          alteram quidem rem introduxeris, scilicet nos, cum totas aetates secus
          credidissemus, nunc aut aliquo modo defectos, sunt enim qui dicant se
          animos percipere, aut ut animum quasi oculis uideamus nondum
          successos, improbo. Quid igitur scientia quantica dicat nihil hic
          refert.
          <br />
          (Addendum censeo Keith fortasse istum Robinson hoc melius exposuisse,
          ipse autem numquam de eo quicquam audii, neque eius argumentum
          refuto.)
          <br />
          Verumtamen consideremus hic scienticam quanticam quae contra quod
          dicis animum adesse probat. Praeclarum experimentum duarum rimarum,
          quo si qua particula spectatur, unam intrat rimam, sin autem non
          spectatur, ueluti unda ambas rimas intrat—quae igitur non sunt
          spectata probabilitates, ut hodierno uocabuli sensu exprimam, sunt,
          quae uero spectantur subito spatium et locum sibi capiunt—, clare
          monstrat materiam solum animis in ipsam intentibus se componere, atque
          nuper, quod maximi momenti est, hoc non tantum inter atomos sed etiam
          ipso in macrocosmo euenire (Gerlich et al, Nature Communications
          2:263, 2011, ut unius mentionem faciam).
          <br />
          Progrederis deinde ad ea quae de cerebro scimus, et animum ueluti
          partem cerebri proponis, ubi nunc iam te non intellego qui animum (aut
          uel animam mecastor) satellitem ante praebuisti. Dicas fortasse te
          uocabulo "conscientia" nec "animus" usum, sed si conscientia ex
          cerebro penderet, animus morte obito caecus euolitaret aut ne
          euolitaret quidem. Necesse est igitur conscientiam ex animo pendere
          sequatur, nisi animus omnino deest, quod ante dicis quam probes.
          <br />
          Postea probas rem cerebri partibus laesis hominem siue uidere non
          posse siue amicos agnoscere nequire dicendo, quod plerumque at non
          semper ita fit. Erant enim (et haud mirar si etiamnunc sint) homines
          aliquid mirabiles qui aliqua parte cerebri remota nihilominus uident
          et amicos agnoscunt, nec scimus quomodo. Quaeras quaeso eum qui
          colores cernere rursus incepit; eum qui schizophrenia afflictus uxorem
          oderat at die quodam, quamquam schizophrenia cerebrum uulnerare
          habetur, subito plane sanus medicis suis se uxorem amare affirmauit
          antequam dormiendo rursus amens delirare iniciperet; eum qui laeuo
          ocello caeco rursus uidere coepit; omnes eos qui postquam cerebro
          laeso omnia ex memoria deposuere rursus meminere; et alios. Potius
          quam radiophonum quo defuncto animus corpori non imperet, postuletur
          animus et corpus inter se agere, cerebrum siue laesum siue ualens
          posse memorias deponere, recordatione prohibere.
          <br />
          Postremo ponis homines post komam aliquam nihil meminisse, animos
          autem tempus percipere, haec inter se non cohaerere. Hoc rursus
          obscure rogatum cum cotidie somniemus alias somnia recordati alias
          obliti, eadem somnia quae una nocte siue horam siue uel menses durare
          possunt! Quid igitur referat si quis non noctem sed septimanam
          dormiat? Quin somnia semper meminimus? Tamen cotidie somniamus et hoc
          scientia nostra iam pridem probatum est. Tamen ne scientia nostra
          quidem respondet quin semper meminerimus.
          <br />
          Insuper nec uigilantes tempus capimus. Graeci enim haec uocabula
          internoscunt, &chi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; atque
          &kappa;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;, illud tempus fugax, hoc
          extraordinarium; illud nocet, hoc momenta aestimat; illud horologia,
          hoc nos recordamur. Ne multa, eodem modo natalem octauum recordamur
          atque quae urbs sit caput Italiae.
          <br />
          Rogasti quid de dictis tuis opinarer. De meis ipsis opinionibus hodie
          nihil dixi, nec uellem, tamen spero me de tuis satis locutum esse.
          Semper ea credimus quae cognoscimus; quae nobis usu ueniunt, quae
          experimur, atque quae patimur. Si quis animum adesse probauit, sine
          iniuria credat, sin autem deesse decreuit, ita potius credat. Nam, ut
          unam ex meis opinionibus denique ostendam, uerum id tantum est quod tu
          ipse uerum esse probas. Nihil alicuius auctoritate, nihil aliorum
          opinione solum tibi proderit, necesse est tu tibi probes atque
          approbes.
          <br />
          Nemo sine uitio natus est. Semper adest animi dispositio, tua autem
          meae dispar. Vt haec animi dispositio remittatur et sic uitam beatam
          agamus multo maioris mihi uidetur momenti quam ut ullam rem omnibus
          ueram monstremus; aliis religio aliis spiritualismus, ut dicitur,
          aliis harum rerum sibi indagatio prosit. Quid autem hoc tibi sit,
          intus quaerendum est.
          <br />
          Animum, ut latine dicimus, ad te ipsum aduerte. Hoc ego censeo. Dixi.
