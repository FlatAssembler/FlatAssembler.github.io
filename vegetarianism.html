        UPDATE on 27/02/2023: I would suggest you watch
        <a href="https://youtu.be/T93tUUZwsFU">this YouTube video</a>
        (in case your browser cannot stream MP4 videos from YouTube, try
        downloading
        <a href="vegetarianism-minified.mp4">this MP4 file from GitHub Pages</a>
        and opening it in VLC or something similar) I've made today about
        vegetarianism. It is much more well-researched than this blog-post I
        made years ago.<br /><br />
	UPDATE on 08/02/2024: I have written <a href="vegegelicism.html">a blog-post on what not to do when doing vegegelicism</a>.<br/><br/>
        If you want to jump to the discussion about how vegetarianism could
        prevent pandemics,

        Well, when I started to explore the world using the Internet, one of the
        first things I found out was that the reasons usually given for eating
        meat are nothing but modern-day myths.<br />It's said that eating meat
        is a natural and healthy way to get the Vitamin B12. However, chances
        are, the meat you can buy in a supermarket doesn't even contain it.
        Vitamin B12 is produced by the bacteria in the intestines of some
        animals. Today, the farmed animals are being regularly fed with
        antibiotics, which, among other things, kill those bacteria. It's often
        said that meat is a good source of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which
        prevent heart disease. Firstly, there isn't much evidence that Omega-3s
        help prevent heart-disease, and, in fact, there are some good reasons to
        think they don't (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 27/11/2020: Let's try to analyze this issue as
          scientifially as possible. There are, as you probably know, two basic
          types of cholesterol, high-density cholesterol (HDL) and low-density
          cholesterol (LDL). LDL causes heart disease, we know that for certain
          because there are many pills that cure heart disease by lowering the
          LDL. As for HDL, as far as I can tell, the best evidence we have
          suggests it has no effect whatsoever on heart health. However, if you
          ask me, there is a huge economic (and therefore political) incentive
          to make people believe HDL lowers the risk of heart disease.
          Omega-3-acids, found in flax, avocados and fish, to simplify, convert
          LDL to HDL. Low levels of alcohol raise HDL without significantly
          affecting LDL. Saturated fat in coconuts, milk, eggs, meat and
          avocados raise both the LDL and HDL. If HDL lowers the risk of heart
          disease, then flax is superfood, alcohol is not as harmful, meat and
          coconuts are not as harmful (or maybe not harmful at all), and so on.
          But there is no good evidence of any of that. Yet, you cannot deny
          there is a huge incentive to make people believe that.</i
        >). Secondly, animals get the Omega-3 from grass, and most of the
        animals farmed for meat today never see the grass, they spend their
        entire lives in the factory farms (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 27/11/2020: A common counter-argument I get when I
          state that are the statistics that only 14% or 18% of food given to
          cows worldwide is grain suitable for humans (implying the rest of it
          is grass). The first problem with that is that the rest of it is not
          actually grass, but mostly high-fiber corn grown specifically for cows
          because their digestive system needs a lot more fiber than our needs.
          High-fiber grain contains no omega-3 acids either. Second, those
          statistics are rather misleading because they ignore the vast
          difference in feed conversion ratio. Feed conversion ratio for cows
          fed with grain suitable for human consumption is around 2 to 1. Feed
          conversion ratio for cows fed with high-fiber grain is around 7 to 1.
          On the other hand, feed conversion ratio for cows fed with grass is so
          high it cannot even be reliably estimated, estimates range from around
          20 to 1 to more than 50 to 1. So, if 10% of cows were fed only with
          grass, and 90% were fed only with grain suitable for humans
          (impossible, but I think this is good for illustrative purposes),
          those statistics would show 50% of food given to cows is grass. See
          how misleading those statistics are? Furthermore, most of the
          omega-3-acids in red meat and milk is ALA. And the claim that ALA
          protects against heart disease is even more scientifically implausible
          than the claim that DHA, the form of omega-3-acid found in fish and
          algae, protects against heart disease. Namely, while it is beyond
          reasonable doubt that DHA raises the HDL cholesterol in humans, it is
          not clear whether ALA even raises the HDL cholesterol in humans in the
          first place. In other words, saying "Well, milk is not harmful because
          it contains omega-3-acids which counter the effects of saturated fat."
          rests on three questionable premises, and it seems to be quite close
          to fractal wrongness.</i
        >). The third argument used to justify eating meat is that it's a way to
        get enough protein. But, here is a thing, we don't actually know how
        much protein an adult human being actually needs. The figure of 35% of
        the energy intake written in many biology textbooks is without a doubt a
        huge overestimation. There are some experts who think that the reason
        there is so much osteoporosis these days is, in fact, that peoples blood
        pH is too low because they are taking too much protein. I am not saying
        they are right, I am just saying there isn't much evidence for some of
        the well-known things about nutrition (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 27/11/2020: As far as I understand it, most
          scientists agree the current epidemic of osteoporosis is caused simply
          by Vitamin K deficiency, which makes studying whether too much protein
          is to blame for osteoporosis difficult and pointless.</i
        >).<br />Some of the other arguments used to justify eating meat is that
        animal agriculture supposedly helps the environment by fertilising the
        ground. The fact is, it does exactly the opposite. Actually, it
        <a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/">hurts the environment</a> at
        least as much as the modern traffic does (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 27/11/2020: Many people will, in response to
          arguments about vegetarianism, say stuff like "<span
            style="
              background: #ffffcc;
              color: black;
              font-family: Times;
              padding: 2px;
            "
            >Well, it does not need to be done that way. We can use animals to
            make use of the infertile land on which we cannot grow plants for
            human consumption. They may even make the ground more fertile.</span
          >". This idea is known as regenerative agriculture. Well, there is a
          number of problems with that. First of all, pigs obviously cannot be
          used that way, since they have almost the same nutritional needs as
          humans have. So, it is still unethical to eat pigs, and probably
          chicken as well. Second, much of the land that is not suitable for
          crops also is not suitable for cows because it is too steep (though
          some more rarely eaten animals, such as goats, can be used that way).
          Third, land that is infertile for crops tends to be fertile not only
          for grass edible by cows, but also poisonous plants. That is less of a
          problem with modern veterinary medicine, but it still is a serious
          problem that makes regenerative agriculture unscalable. Fourth,
          however messy this part of ecology may be, all the scholars agree a
          massive switch from grain-fed cows to grass-fed cows would be a bad
          thing for the climate, because grass-fed cows emit much more methane.
          Fifth, the evidence we have that grazing makes soil less fertile is
          very hard, and the evidence that it can make soil more fertile if
          properly managed is anecdotal at best. Sixth, and most important, how
          is that relevant to us? Let us say there is a technology which can
          make use of vast areas of infertile land. Let us also say that it, as
          hard as it is to believe, uses animals and produces meat. So what?
          Meat you and I can buy is most likely produced in factory farms which
          destroy the environment with antibiotics, or, less likely, from poorly
          managed pastures. If you buy meat today, you are damaging the
          environment, and this should not be controversial.</i
        >). The other one is that it's supposedly easy to show that animals are
        incapable of higher cognitive functions. But, what requires little
        intelligence in humans often requires high intelligence in computers and
        vice versa, and who knows about animals (see
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox"
          >The Moravec's Paradox</a
        >).<br />Of course, the most common argument for eating meat is that
        it's supposedly natural. Now, how exactly people think first humans were
        hunting before the tools necessary for that were invented, I have no
        idea. Being able to eat meat probably helped our ancestors survive in
        some cases. Today, it does more harm than good, and that's clear to
        everyone who looks at the evidence.<br />Vitamin B12 deficiency wasn't a
        problem for our ancestors, because they didn't use to clean the fruits
        and vegetables before eating them, and many bacteria in dust also
        produce Vitamin B12. Today, it's probably not a good idea. The best
        source of the Vitamin B12 today is probably shellfish. Many foods,
        including some exotic plants, contain it, but our body doesn't absorb it
        from them well. Since around a third of the worlds' population is
        deficient in the Vitamin B12, it's probably a good idea to take it in
        form of vitamin pills. Some plants, like flax, contain a lot of Omega-3.
        However, it contains a different form of Omega-3 than our body needs,
        and our bodies aren't good at converting between different forms of
        Omega-3. So, it's not entirely clear if it's better to get Omega-3 from
        plants or from fish. The foods richest in proteins are beans and cheese.
        Of course, not all protein is equal, and what our body actually needs is
        to get all the essential amino acids from the protein in our diet. The
        soybeans contain enough of all the essential amino acids except the
        methionine, and the seeds rich in methionine are sesame seeds. However,
        it's also important not to eat too much methionine. In fact, the dangers
        of getting too much methionine probably outweigh the dangers of getting
        too little methionine. And milk of cows, and so do cheese and red meat,
        probably contains much more methionine than human body needs. Some
        nutritionists think that, paradoxically, the reason why vegetarians tend
        to have lower rates of heart disease is that many of them are
        "deficient" in methionine.<br />
        Contrary to popular belief, spinach isn't rich in iron at all. The best
        vegetarian source of iron is probably lentil (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 12/12/2020: It is sometimes argued that red meat is
          a very good source of iron because of the heme-iron in it, present in
          no other food, and being absorbed a lot better than free iron.
          However, it is nearly universally agreed that heme-iron mixed with
          omega-6-acids, present in meat and even more so in processed meat,
          causes colon cancer. And, considering that anemia caused by the actual
          lack of iron is rather rare, a risk-benefit analysis is unlikely to
          favor ingesting heme-iron. </i
        >).<br />
        I hope this was enough information for you to understand vegetarianism.I
        am not arguing for forcing people to be vegetarian (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 21/10/2023: Like I've explained elsewhere on this
          website, I am nearly sure that making meat illegal would make
          pandemics like COVID-19 significantly more common, because, if meat is
          illegal, like it is illegal to eat bats in China, animals which are
          being kept for food don't receive basic veterinary care. That's why,
          with the exception of the Spanish Flu, all the pandemics in recent
          history came from <b>illegal</b> meat. I think that is enough reason
          not to make meat illegal. That's not to say all regulations regarding
          animal agriculture are bad. Probably any regulation that reduces the
          massive use of antibiotics in the egg industry is a sensible
          regulation.</i
        >), I just hope I've made some people think. Many people want to make
        the world a better place. But the right way to do that is to start from
        yourself. Do you strive not to cause unnecessary suffering of the
        innocent?<br />
        (<i
          ><b>UPDATE</b> on 16/12/2021: On the Internet forums, I have often
          seen the argument that the studies showing vegetarianism is healthier
          for humans suffer from one-size-fits-all mindset, that vegetarianism
          might be healthier for some people but not for others depending on the
          genes. I think a good response to that argument is that human beings
          have less genetic variation than within a single breed of dog. If
          one-size-fits-all does not work for humans, by the same logic some
          dogs ought to be vegetarians. And I think most people would agree it
          is absurd to say that.</i

        <br />UPDATE on 28/07/2018: I've just written a
        <a href="antiveg.html">parody</a> showing how anti-vegetarian propaganda
        sounds like to vegetarians (and to everybody else, I suppose).<br />

          (magna insecta) etiam non possunt subolem habere, si eae non occidant
          et edant mares suos. An eius causa, quodam modo, licitum est

          Argumenta pro carne edenda, quae saepe dantur, sunt:<br />
          1) <i>Carnis minime carus modus vitamini B12 acquirendi est.</i><br />
          Ita, multa animalia, boves inter alia, habent, in suis lactibus
          (intestinis), bacteria quae vitaminum B12 faciunt. Sed in carne, quae
          non cara est, vitaminum B12 paene non datur. Bubus, et aliis
          animalibus quae edimus, hodie semper antibiotica dantur. Ea
          antibiotica protegunt ea animalia a morbis, quos bacteria faciunt,
          quia ea animalia paene semper in parvis et sordidis spatiis sita sunt.
          Sed antibiotica etiam ea bacteria, quae vitaminum B12 faciunt,
          occidunt. Antibiotica enim et bona et mala bacteria occidunt. Carnis
          piscium vitaminum B12 continet, sed caro piscium multo carior (plures
          pecunias debes dare, ut carnem piscium possis emere) pilulis quae
          vitaminum B12 continent est.<br />
          Dare magnam summam antibioticorum animalibus etiam possibile facit, ut
          aliquae bacteria, quae et animalia et homines morbidos faciunt, ab
          antibioticis invulnerabilia fiant. Materia genetica, de
          invulnerabilitate ab antibioticis, in paene omnibus bacteriis data
          est, et ea potest activa fieri. Probabiliter, id fit iam hodie. Forsan
          multos morbos, quae hodie possumus curare antibioticis, in futura non
          poterimus curare... carnem edendi causa.<br />
          2) <i>Edere magnam summam omega-3-acidi protegit a morbis cordis.</i

          Simpliciter, hoc non est veritas. Evidentia huius non datur. Et si hoc
          veritas esset, non debeamus magnam summam carnis edere, debeamus
          magnam summam lini edere. Linum enim plenius omega-3-acidis quam caro
          est.<br />

        UPDATE on 29/06/2020: I've made a quick meme about how absurd it is to
        blame people who eat bats for not caring about their diet causing
        dangerous pandemics, when most of the these days people do the same:

        <span id="VegetarianismAgainstPandemics"
          >Now, admittedly, the relationship between pandemics and eating meat
          is complicated. It is hard to determine where some pandemic came from
          with reasonable certainty. However, I do not think any expert doubts
          that most of the pandemics in the last century came from eating meat.
          And primarily it comes from the animal husbandry practices with
          animals closely related to humans and/or without modern veterinary
          care. COVID-19 is widely agreed to have come from wet markets in Wuhan
          where people were eating bats. While there are some experts who
          dispute that, the reasons seem to be political correctness (modern
          <i>anti-racism</i>, which is anything but anti-racism actually) and
          very weak arguments. The primary argument seems to be some interviewed
          people, who were at the wet market at the time, being unaware of bats
          being sold there, which is a textbook example of argument from
          ignorance. Bats, while they are anatomically very different from
          humans, they have a very similar immune system, and the attacks
          viruses use to attack bat cells often work to attack human cells. Bats
          also may be particularly dangerous to eat considering that they are
          almost always active at night while sleeping during the day. Germs
          spread more easily during the night, when there is no sun killing the
          germs (I have asked a
          <a
            href="https://www.quora.com/Do-monkeys-get-infected-with-coronaviruses-like-bats-do-If-so-how-do-they-spread-among-monkeys-given-that-the-sun-kills-coronaviruses-and-monkeys-are-not-active-during-the-night"
            >Quora question</a
          >
          about that). EBOLA is also widely agreed to be caused by people eating
          infected fruit bats, though there is some controversy about that. HIV
          is, as far as I know, universally agreed to have been caused by people
          eating monkeys (Yes, the evolution of HIV, a virus that shuts down the
          immune system by modifying your DNA in a specific manner, is hard to
          understand, I have asked a

            >Quora question</a
          >
          about that as well). The Spanish Flu of 1918 is now widely agreed to
          have been caused by people eating infected chickens in Kansas, USA.<br />While
          it may at first be tempting to think banning meat would lead to
          significantly fewer pandemics (Even Ben Shapiro, who is otherwise
          somewhat anti-vegetarian, expressing worries that widespread
          vegetarianism would lead to widespread lysine deficiency, said
          &quot;<i
            >I am mostly libertarian about what people eat, I mostly think
            people should eat whatever they want, but, if you are going to be
            eating wild animals, then, I am sorry, but that has such a huge
            externality that it has to be illegal and cracked down on.</i
          >&quot;), paradoxically, it may even put us into a greater danger. If
          meat is legal, animals grown for meat receive at least basic
          veterinary care. If meat is illegal, people still eat it, but they eat
          it illegally (It might be a good idea to ban preventative use of
          antibiotics in farmed animals to prevent a pandemic of superbacteria,
          though, and I have asked a
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/vog4ee/what_is_wrong_with_government_banning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3"
            >question on an Internet forum about preventing superbacteria</a
          >.). It is illegal to eat bats in China, and, thanks to that, bats
          which are eaten do not receive basic veterinary care. Veterinary
          medicine was at its infancy in 1918 and was greatly stifled by the
          war. The science of how viruses that jump across species lead to
          pandemics instead of dying out due to inbreeding (when two viruses
          infect the same cell) is complicated, and I have asked a
          <a

            >question on Quora</a
          >
          about it (the linked answer basically says that, while inbreeding is a
          problem for influenza viruses, it is not nearly as much of a problem
          as it is for multicellular organisms, and that inbreeding is not at
          all a problem for coronaviruses, since coronaviruses are haploid), but
          it is not controversial at all that this happens.<br />
          In the modern day of factory farming, of course, another danger
          exists, and it is antibiotically resistant bacteria. I do not think
          any expert would deny that factory farming is the biggest cause of
          antibiotic resistance in humans. Estimates for what percentage of
          antibiotics goes to farmed animals range between 70% to above 90%. The
          vast majority of those antibiotics are fed to animals without proper
          diagnosis, or without any diagnosis whatsoever, they are given
          preventatively. But antibiotics do not <i>prevent</i> illnesses, they
          <b>suppress</b> them. And a pandemic of an antibiotic resistant will
          burst out that will kill not only the animals which are supposed to be
          protected by those antibiotics, that pandemic will also kill many
          people. And it is not a question of whether it will happen, it is a
          question of when it will happen. It is similar to nuclear weapons:
          maybe nuclear weapons suppress war (which is doubtful), but they
          certainly don't prevent it, as there is small but real chance of
          nuclear weapons being fired accidentally. Now, of course, it is hard
          to quantify what effect giving antibiotics to farmed animals has on
          antibiotic resistance in humans. Most of the antibiotics go to
          chicken, animals rather distantly related to humans. Bacteria which
          can jump between chicken and humans are rare. However, it is hard to
          argue it is negligible. Furthermore, a non-negligible amount of
          antibiotics is indeed given to animals rather closely related to
          humans that are pigs. As I said, I do not think any expert would deny
          that at lest 50% of antibiotic resistance in humans is caused by
          factory farming.<br />
          I believe the COVID-19 pandemic has given us a brief insight of what
          life was like for those who came before us, before modern medicine.
          Consider, for unvaccinated people untreated influenza has death rate
          of around 0.5%, similar to what COVID-19 has. In centuries of history,
          death from influenza was as normal as death from COVID-19 is these
          days. In centuries of history, going to a public event or even to
          public baths if you are elderly or have weak immune system was a death
          sentence, much like it is today, at the time of COVID-19 pandemic. In
          centuries of history, there were always diseases spreading around
          which people did not fully understand, and for which there was no
          effective prevention or effective cure, like the COVID-19 was at the
          beginning of the pandemic. In centuries of history, medicine was
          usually counter-productive, like it was to some degree (though not
          nearly as it was in the centuries of history) at the beginning of the
          COVID-19 pandemic, back when doctors were trying useless and dangerous
          &quot;<i>cures</i>&quot; based on anecdotal evidence and wild guesses
          based on what we know about how human body works (which is still not
          everything). And governments were compelled to try to control the
          pandemics with damaging policies with dubious effectiveness, just like
          they are today (<i
            >UPDATE: I have written a
            <a href="let_it_rip.html"
              >blog-post explaining why I think the mainstream pandemic
              management (with lockdowns and mask mandates) is worse than
              useless</a
            >.</i
          >). We should do everything we can to prevent us from returning to the
          centuries of history, or going into something even worse. Stopping
          eating meat might result in some economic damages, but it will not
          result in something worse than a pandemic. Making the Earth slightly
          warmer by switching from factory-farmed cows to pasture-raised cows
          will also result in some economic damage, but I doubt it will produce
          as much damage as a pandemic of an antibiotic-resistant bacteria
          produced by factory farming will do. I think that, before the COVID-19
          pandemic, the dangers of a pandemic were minimized in the eyes of the
          public. They are not any more, and that will be good for the
          vegetarian movement, and generally for movements against factory
          farming and against bushmeat.<br />
          Before the pandemic, people were not too afraid of a germ that would
          kill 0.5% of people it infects, vastly disproportionatly killing the
          already sick. They thought they will not be killed by the virus, so
          such a pandemic would not affect them. Well, first of all, I think
          many people who were killed by the virus thought the same. Second, a
          pandemic is not just the germ, it is also people losing their mind.
          The germ would have been easily avoidable if many people did not
          respond to the pandemic by rushing into grocery stores buying
          unreasonable amounts of everyday products, leading to people being
          forced to buy food in overcrowded stores and shortages of everyday
          products. When the only way to get food is to go into crowded stores,
          whether or not you will get the germ is dumb luck. Pandemic is also
          economy crashing, partly due to the germ itself and partly due to
          government policies supposed to slow down the spread of the pandemic,
          which are, of course, of questionable efficacy. And a pandemic of a
          germ we can do little or nothing about is, of course, accompanied by a
          pandemic of suicide we can do little or nothing about. Suicides,
          mostly in form of drug overdoses, rose around 11% in 2020, vastly
          disproportionately affecting, for a reason that escapes me, the young
          and the children (who suffered the least from the bad economic effects
          of COVID-19), possibly costing about as many life-years as the
          pandemic itself has. And a pandemic can be a lot worse. While very
          rare, there are germs that disproportionately kill the young and
          people with strong immune systems by turning peoples' immune system
          against them. H5N1 is an example, and Spanish Flu may have been like
          that (although it is hard to tell from the data we have, it can be
          that the young were simply more malnutritioned back then because of
          the war). What if something like that is the next horrible thing that
          comes from bushmeat? And multiple vaccines against COVID-19, a virus
          only distantly related to some viruses we knew something about
          (causing nothing more than common cold in humans and having never been
          given much attention), having been found in less than a year is almost
          miraculous. There are germs that have been evading our attempts to
          find a vaccine that would work in humans, such as HIV or Hepatitis C,
          for decades. The next pandemic of a virus coming from bushmeat or a
          bacteria resistant to antibiotics coming from factory farming could
          easily last much longer, perhaps, just like in case of Spanish Flu
          (though it is not likely today, given that we understand germs far
          better now), vaccine never being found and the germ burning itself out
          only after having killed tens of millions of people. We have seen that
          even a mild pandemic can be incredibly damaging, and we know a much
          worse one can emerge from bushmeat or factory farming.<br />
          One of the worst things about a pandemic is that it drives some people
          so much out of their minds that, while there are people dying gasping
          for air in a gym down the road (because hospitals are overwhelmed),
          they say stuff like &quot;<i
            >Well, who cares that there is a pandemic? Most of the people who
            died from COVID-19 would have died later this year or the very next
            year anyway.</i
          >&quot; (and, apparenlty, a few years worth of playing with
          grandchildren counts for nothing, never mind that it is
          <a
            href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-say-an-average-person-who-died-from-COVID-19-would-live-another-decade-when-half-of-the-people-in-the-USA-who-died-from-COVID-19-were-in-nursing-homes-and-an-average-life-expectancy-for-people-in"
            >hard to tell</a
          >
          whether that statement is even true) or even &quot;<i
            >Well, this pandemic is a good thing because it is an awakening.
            Because of the pandemic, there is less smog in the air.</i
          >&quot; (apparently, people being afraid to travel due to the pandemic
          is somehow a good thing according to some people). I hope that, in
          spite of such people, something actually useful will be done in order
          to minimize future pandemics. I guess people who deny this pandemic is
          a serious issue are suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome, and that
          most people are denying factory farming is a serious issue for about
          the same reason.</span

          You can <i>perhaps</i> say that about heart health. Maybe saturated

        even a question, the real question is whether that relationship is

          <p>
            Proponents of keto-diets (low-carbohydrate low-protein diets)
            sometimes claim that eating too much protein (that red meat is high
            in) causes type-2-diabetes, the supposed mechanism being that too
            much protein causes gluconeogenesis and raises blood sugar. But, as
            far as I understand it, that's bullshit, because gluconeogenesis is
            triggered by the pancreas hormone called glucagon, and has nothing
            to do with protein in blood.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have heard some people claim that saturated fat (and red meat is
            relatively high in saturated fat), like fructose, causes the liver
            to become resistant to insulin. However, as far as I understand it,
            whether that effect exists at all is disputed, and therefore it
            can't be nearly as big as the effect of fructose. It can hardly be
            used as the explanation for the strong correlation between red meat
            consumption and type-2-diabetes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have heard some people speculate that it's the heme iron (found
            basically only in red meat) somehow causing the pancreas to produce
            less insulin, but that, as far as I understand it, doesn't agree
            with the data. People with type-2-diabetes almost always have higher
            insulin levels than people without type-2-diabetes, rather than
            lower.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've heard some people suggest it could be that people eating a lot
            of red meat are eating less plants, and that it is something in
            plants that decreases the risk of type-2-diabetes. But what could it
            possibly be? I have heard some people speculate that omega-3-acids
            decrease the risk of type-2-diabetes, but, again, whether that
            effect exists at all is disputed, and it's difficult to imagine it
            is so big to explain the correlation between red meat and
            type-2-diabetes.
          </p>

          <p>I was wondering what you think about that?</p>
        </div>
        While there is a plausible mechanism for red meat causing colon cancer
        (heme iron) and heart disease (saturated fat), there doesn't appear to
        be a plausible mechanism for red meat to cause type-2-diabetes. And, to
        me at least, mechanistic evidence is far more important than
        observational studies. That's not to say red meat (and, for that sake,
        coconuts) cannot make type-2-diabetes worse once you have it: people
        with type-2-diabetes appear to be way more sensitive to saturated fat
        than the rest of the population.
